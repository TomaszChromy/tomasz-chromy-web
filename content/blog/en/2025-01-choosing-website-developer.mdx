Choosing a website developer is one of the more important business decisions. A bad decision means wasted time, money, and nerves. A good one – a website that works for your business for years.

In this article, I'll show you how to approach choosing a developer, what to look for, and what warning signs to avoid.

## Market Options

### Freelancer

**Pros:**
- Lower price (no company markup)
- Direct contact
- Flexibility
- Individual approach

**Cons:**
- One person = risk (illness, vacation, disappearance)
- Limited skills (rarely designer + developer + copywriter)
- No substitutability

**Price:** $500 – $2,500

### Agency

**Pros:**
- Team of specialists
- Processes and guarantees
- Substitutability
- Comprehensive service

**Cons:**
- Higher price
- Possibly less flexibility
- Sometimes you're a "small client"

**Price:** $2,000 – $15,000+

### No-code Platforms (Wix, Squarespace)

**Pros:**
- Low cost
- Quick start
- You control it

**Cons:**
- Limited capabilities
- Often amateur result
- Poor SEO

**Price:** $0 – $500/year

## What to Look For?

### 1. Portfolio

Most important indicator. Check:
- Have they made sites similar to yours?
- Do portfolio sites still work?
- How do they look on mobile?
- How fast do they load?

**Red flag:** No portfolio or only screenshots (no links).

### 2. Reviews and References

- Google, Facebook, LinkedIn
- References from specific clients
- Case studies with results

**Red flag:** Zero reviews or only 5-star with no content.

### 3. Initial Conversation

A good developer:
- Asks about your business and goals
- Listens, doesn't just talk
- Advises, doesn't just take orders
- Says what they don't do

**Red flag:** Immediately gives price without asking for details.

### 4. Work Process

Ask:
- What's the process from start to launch?
- How many approval stages?
- Who provides content and photos?
- How many revisions are included?

**Red flag:** No clear process ("send materials, I'll do it").

### 5. Contract and Rights

Check:
- Is there a written contract?
- Who owns the project after completion?
- What if collaboration fails?
- What are payment terms?

**Red flag:** No contract or "we'll agree verbally."

### 6. Post-launch Support

Ask:
- What happens if something breaks?
- Is there technical support?
- Who updates the site?
- How much does maintenance cost?

**Red flag:** "After launch, we end collaboration."

## Questions Worth Asking

### About experience:
- How many sites have you made in similar industry?
- Can I talk to a previous client?
- How long have you been operating?

### About project:
- What's included in scope?
- What's NOT included?
- How many revisions included?
- Who writes the texts?

### About technology:
- What technology will the site use?
- Can I edit content myself?
- Will the site be fast and SEO optimized?

### About costs:
- What's the total cost?
- What are annual costs (hosting, domain)?
- What if scope changes?

## Red Flags – When to Run?

### 1. Very Low Price

"Website for $100" = template with minimal customization, no optimization, zero support.

### 2. No Portfolio

If there's nothing to show – either just starting or previous projects failed.

### 3. No Contract

Without a contract, you have no protection. If something goes wrong – you're left with nothing.

### 4. Everything "No Problem"

A professional says what they don't do and where limitations are. Someone who agrees to everything often doesn't deliver.

### 5. No Questions About Your Business

If developer doesn't ask about goals, target audience, competition – they won't understand what to do.

### 6. Long Response Time

If email response takes a week before project – what will it be like during?

## How to Compare Offers?

Don't compare just price. Compare:

| Criterion | Offer A | Offer B |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Price | $X | $Y |
| Number of pages | | |
| CMS / content editing | | |
| SEO optimization | | |
| Responsiveness | | |
| Number of revisions | | |
| Delivery time | | |
| Post-launch support | | |
| Project rights | | |

## My Checklist Before Signing

## Summary

Choosing a website developer isn't just about price. Check:

- **Portfolio** – have they done similar projects?
- **Reviews** – what do previous clients say?
- **Process** – do they know how to work professionally?
- **Contract** – are you protected?
- **Support** – what after launch?

A good developer is an investment. A bad one – waste of time and money.
