After several years of designing websites, I've noticed a pattern. Regardless of industry, company size, or budget – the same mistakes appear time and time again. And it's not about technical or aesthetic issues.

It's about strategic mistakes that make a website look professional but generate no business results.

## Mistake #1: No Clear Website Goal

I ask a client: "What is the main goal of your website?"

Answer: "To have an online presence."

That's not a goal. That's just presence. And presence without a goal is a waste of money.

**How to fix it:**
- Define one main goal (lead, sale, signup, contact)
- Design the entire site around that goal
- Measure whether the goal is being achieved

## Mistake #2: Talking About Yourself Instead of the Customer

"We are industry leaders", "We have 20 years of experience", "Our company offers comprehensive solutions".

Users don't care. They care about one thing: **what they'll gain**.

**How to fix it:**
- Replace "we" with "you"
- Write about benefits, not features
- Address customer problems, not your achievements

**Wrong:** "We have 15 years of experience in IT"  
**Right:** "Your website will work flawlessly for years"

## Mistake #3: Hero That Says Nothing

"Welcome to our website" is the worst possible headline. The user already knows they're on your website – they clicked there consciously.

**How to fix it:**
- Say what you do (specifically)
- Say who you help
- Say what problem you solve

**Template:** "I help [who] achieve [what] through [how]"

## Mistake #4: No Call to Action (CTA)

The user read your page, they're interested... now what? They don't know. Because you didn't tell them what to do.

**How to fix it:**
- Add a clear CTA button
- Repeat the CTA several times on the page
- Use specific words ("Book a free consultation", not "Click")

## Mistake #5: Too Much Information at Once

The homepage is not a company encyclopedia. Trying to show everything at once creates chaos that paralyzes users.

**How to fix it:**
- Limit information to the essential minimum
- Use importance hierarchy
- Guide the user step by step
- Move details to subpages

## Mistake #6: No Social Proof

You claim to be a professional. But where's the evidence?

**How to fix it:**
- Add client testimonials (with name and company)
- Show logos of companies you've worked with
- Include case studies with concrete results
- Provide numbers (e.g., "200+ completed projects")

## Mistake #7: Outdated or Neglected Website

Copyright © 2019, last blog post from 3 years ago, broken links, outdated information.

User thinks: "Does this company even still exist?"

**How to fix it:**
- Update copyright automatically with JavaScript
- Regularly check all elements are working
- Remove outdated content
- If you don't maintain a blog – better not to have one

## Mistake #8: Ignoring Mobile Devices

Over 60% of internet traffic comes from mobile devices. A website that doesn't work on phones loses most potential customers.

**How to fix it:**
- Test the site on different devices
- Make sure buttons are large enough
- Check that forms are comfortable to fill out
- Optimize loading time on mobile networks

## Mistake #9: Slow Loading

Every second of delay reduces conversion by 7%. Users are impatient – if the site doesn't load, they leave.

**How to fix it:**
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript code
- Use fast hosting
- Enable caching

**Goal:** Loading time under 3 seconds.

## Mistake #10: No Analytics

How can you improve something you don't measure? Without data, you're operating blindly.

**How to fix it:**
- Install Google Analytics 4
- Set up goals (conversions)
- Track where users come from
- Analyze which pages work and which don't

## Checklist for Auditing Your Website

Review your website and answer these questions:

- [ ] Is it clear within 5 seconds what I do?
- [ ] Do I talk about benefits for the customer?
- [ ] Do I have a clear CTA?
- [ ] Do I have testimonials and social proof?
- [ ] Does the site work well on mobile?
- [ ] Does it load in less than 3 seconds?
- [ ] Do all links work?
- [ ] Is the information up to date?
- [ ] Do I have analytics installed?

If you answered "no" to more than 3 questions – it's time for changes.

## Summary

Most business website mistakes are not technical issues, but strategic ones. They stem from a lack of clear goals, wrong messaging, or ignoring user needs.

The good news? They can all be fixed. Some require just a few adjustments, others – deeper strategic thinking.
