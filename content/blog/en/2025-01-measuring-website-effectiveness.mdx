You have a website. It looks good, sometimes someone reaches out. But do you know how many people visit it? Where do they come from? How many fill out the form?

If you don't measure – you don't know if the site works. In this article, I'll show you what and how to measure to make decisions based on data, not hunches.

## Why Measuring Matters?

### Without data, you're flying blind

You don't know:
- Whether the site generates traffic
- Where that traffic comes from
- Whether people do what you expect
- What works and what doesn't

### With data, you make better decisions

You know:
- Which page brings the most inquiries
- Where the best clients come from
- What to improve to increase conversion
- Whether ad investment pays off

## Tools You Need

### Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

Basic traffic analysis tool. Free. Shows:
- How many people visit the site
- Where they come from (Google, social, ads)
- What pages they view
- How long they stay
- Whether they complete goals (conversions)

### Google Search Console

Data directly from Google. Shows:
- What phrases the site appears for
- How many times people clicked from Google results
- What positions you hold
- Whether there are technical errors

### Hotjar / Microsoft Clarity

Tools for user behavior analysis:
- Heatmaps (where they click)
- Session recordings (how they move around)
- Scroll depth (how far they scroll)

Microsoft Clarity is free.

## Key Metrics – What to Track?

### 1. Number of Users

How many people visit your site in a given period.

**How to interpret:**
- Rising = more people finding the site
- Falling = traffic problem (SEO, ads, seasonality)

### 2. Traffic Sources

Where users come from:
- **Organic Search** – from Google results
- **Direct** – typed address directly
- **Social** – from social media
- **Paid Search** – from Google ads
- **Referral** – from other sites

**How to interpret:**
- Diverse sources = lower risk
- One source dominance = vulnerable to changes

### 3. Bounce Rate

Percentage of people who entered and left without interaction.

**Benchmarks:**
- Below 40% – good
- 40-60% – needs improvement
- Above 60% – problem

**High bounce rate may mean:**
- Slow loading
- Unattractive page
- Mismatch with expectations (ad promises one thing, page shows another)

### 4. Average Time on Page

How long users spend on the page.

**How to interpret:**
- Above 2 minutes – content engages
- Below 30 seconds – problem with content or UX

### 5. Pages per Session

How many subpages an average user views.

**How to interpret:**
- More = users exploring the offer
- Few = leaving quickly or everything on one page

### 6. Conversions (Goals)

Most important metric. How many people perform desired action:
- Form submission
- Phone call
- Newsletter signup
- Purchase

**Conversion Rate (CR):**
Percentage of visits ending in conversion.
- 1-3% – typical for business sites
- 5-10% – good landing page
- 10%+ – excellent result

## How to Set Up Goals in GA4?

### Step 1: Define What's a Conversion

For business sites, typical goals:
- Contact form submission
- Click on phone number
- Click on email address
- Download material (PDF, pricing)

### Step 2: Configure Events

In GA4, conversions are based on events:
- `form_submit` – form submission
- `click` on `tel:` link – phone
- `click` on `mailto:` link – email

### Step 3: Mark Event as Conversion

In GA4: Configure → Events → Mark as Conversion

### Step 4: Test

Perform the action yourself and check if the event was recorded.

## How to Analyze Data?

### Weekly Review (15 min)

- How many users?
- Where did they come from?
- How many conversions?
- Any significant changes?

### Monthly Review (1h)

- Trends vs previous month
- Most popular pages
- Pages with highest conversion
- Best lead sources

### Quarterly Review (2-3h)

- Long-term trends
- Comparison with previous quarters
- Campaign and investment analysis
- Action planning

## Summary

Measuring website effectiveness is fundamental to conscious management:

1. **Install GA4 and Search Console** – minimum
2. **Set up goals** – without this, you don't know if you're converting
3. **Track key metrics** – traffic, sources, bounce rate, conversions
4. **Analyze regularly** – weekly, monthly, quarterly
5. **Act on data** – not hunches

A website without analytics is like a store without a cash register – you don't know how much you're earning.
