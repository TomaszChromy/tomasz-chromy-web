On-page SEO is the optimization of elements that are on your website – as opposed to off-page (external links) or technical SEO (infrastructure). These are elements you have full control over.

In this article, I'll show you what you can improve yourself to increase visibility in Google.

## What Is On-Page SEO?

It's optimization of:
- Content (texts, headings)
- Meta tags (title, description)
- Page structure (URL, internal linking)
- Media (images, video)

Goal: Help Google understand what the page is about and why it's valuable to users.

## 1. Page Title (Title Tag)

This is the most important on-page SEO element. It appears in:
- Google results (blue link)
- Browser tab
- Social media shares

**How to optimize:**
- Up to 60 characters (longer gets cut off)
- Main keyword at the beginning
- Unique for each page
- Encouraging to click

**Template:** `[Keyword] – [Expansion] | [Brand]`

**Example:** `Websites for Businesses – Professional Projects | Tomasz Chromy`

## 2. Meta Description

The description under the title in Google results. Doesn't directly affect rankings, but affects CTR (click-through rate).

**How to optimize:**
- Up to 160 characters
- Contains keyword (Google bolds it)
- Describes what user will find
- Encourages clicking (call to action)

## 3. Headings (H1, H2, H3)

Headings structure content and help Google understand information hierarchy.

**H1** – one per page, main keyword
**H2** – page sections, related phrases
**H3** – subsections, details

**Mistakes to avoid:**
- Multiple H1s on page
- Skipping levels (H1 → H3)
- Using headings only for styling

## 4. Page Content

Google evaluates content quality and relevance. Key elements:

### Length
- Service pages: min. 300-500 words
- Blog articles: min. 800-1500 words
- Pillar pages: 2000+ words

### Keywords
- Main phrase in first 100 words
- Natural use (no keyword stuffing)
- Synonyms and related phrases

### Structure
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullets and lists
- Headings every 200-300 words
- Summaries and conclusions

### Value
- Answers user questions
- Provides specific information
- Is current

## 5. Page URL

URL should be:
- Short and readable
- Contain keyword
- Without special characters
- Without unnecessary parameters

**Good:** `/services/web-development`
**Bad:** `/page.php?id=15&cat=2`

## 6. Images

Images are often overlooked in SEO.

### File Name
- Descriptive, with keyword
- `business-website-design.webp` instead of `IMG_4532.jpg`

### Alternative Text (Alt)
- Describes what the image shows
- Contains keyword (naturally)
- Up to 125 characters

### Size Optimization
- WebP format
- Compression without quality loss
- Proper dimensions (not 4000px for thumbnail)

## 7. Internal Linking

Links between pages on your site:
- Help Google understand structure
- Pass SEO "power" between pages
- Facilitate user navigation

**How to link:**
- From articles to related content
- Anchor text describing target page
- Natural placement in text
- Not just in menu and footer

## 8. Schema Markup (Structured Data)

Code that helps Google understand content type:

**For business sites:**
- LocalBusiness
- Organization
- Service

**For blog:**
- Article
- FAQ
- HowTo
- BreadcrumbList

**Effect:** Rich snippets in results (stars, FAQ, breadcrumbs).

## 9. Core Web Vitals

Speed and UX metrics that affect rankings:

**LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** – main content loading time
- Goal: < 2.5s

**INP (Interaction to Next Paint)** – click responsiveness
- Goal: < 200ms

**CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** – visual stability
- Goal: < 0.1

## 10. Mobile-First

Google checks mobile version first:
- Responsive design
- Readable text without zoom
- Buttons large enough for touch
- Fast loading on 4G

## On-Page SEO Checklist

For each important page check:

- [ ] Title tag – unique, up to 60 chars, with keyword
- [ ] Meta description – up to 160 chars, encouraging
- [ ] H1 – one, contains main keyword
- [ ] H2/H3 headings – logical structure
- [ ] Content – min. 300 words, valuable
- [ ] URL – short, readable
- [ ] Images – optimized, with alt text
- [ ] Internal links – to related pages
- [ ] Mobile – site works on phone
- [ ] Speed – loads < 3 seconds

## Summary

On-page SEO is the foundation of visibility. Key elements:

- **Title and meta description** – well optimized
- **Headings** – logical structure with keywords
- **Content** – valuable and proper length
- **Images** – optimized with alt text
- **Internal linking** – connecting related pages

These are elements you have full control over. Use them.
