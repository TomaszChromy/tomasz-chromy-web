Most companies think about SEO after launching their site. "The site is up, now we need to optimize it." This is a mistake that costs months of delay.

SEO starts **before** publication. In this article, I'll show you what to prepare so your site has the best possible start.

## Why SEO Before Launch?

### Structure Changes Are Costly

Changing URLs after indexing = losing rankings and needing redirects.

### Google Indexes Quickly

Often a site gets indexed within days. First impression matters.

### Technical Fixes Are Easier

It's easier to fix structure before publication than to rebuild a live site.

## SEO Checklist Before Launch

### 1. URL Structure

**Good URLs:**
- Short and readable
- Contain keywords
- Without special characters
- Without dates (unless it's a blog)
- Without parameters (?id=123)

**Example:**
- ✅ `/services/web-development`
- ❌ `/services.php?id=3&cat=web`

### 2. Page Titles (Title Tag)

Every page must have a unique title:
- Up to 60 characters
- Contains main keyword
- Most important word at the beginning
- Encourages clicking

**Template:** `[Main keyword] – [Expansion] | [Company name]`

### 3. Meta Description

Description displayed in Google results:
- Up to 160 characters
- Contains keyword
- Encourages clicking
- Unique for each page

**Template:** Describe what user will find + call to action.

### 4. Headings (H1, H2, H3)

**H1:** One per page, contains main keyword
**H2:** Page sections, related keywords
**H3:** Subsections, details

**Mistakes:**
- Multiple H1s on page
- Headings used only for styling
- No keywords

### 5. Image Alt Text

Every image should have a description:
- What the image shows
- Naturally included keyword
- Up to 125 characters

### 6. Optimized Content

Every important page:
- Min. 300-500 words (service pages)
- Min. 800-1500 words (blog articles)
- Natural keyword use
- Headings structuring text
- Internal links

### 7. Sitemap.xml

Site map for Google:
- Generated automatically by CMS
- Contains all important URLs
- Updated with changes

**Check:** yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml

### 8. Robots.txt

File controlling robot access:
- Don't block important pages
- Point to sitemap location
- Block technical pages (admin, empty cart)

**Basic robots.txt:**
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

### 9. HTTPS (SSL)

SSL certificate is required:
- Google prefers HTTPS
- Browsers warn about HTTP
- Users don't trust "unsecured" sites

### 10. Loading Speed

Optimize before launch:
- Images in WebP format
- Minimized CSS and JavaScript
- Lazy loading for images
- Fast hosting

**Goal:** LCP < 2.5s

### 11. Mobile Version

Mobile-first indexing = Google checks mobile version first:
- Responsive design
- Readable text without zoom
- Buttons large enough for touch
- No elements extending beyond screen

### 12. Structured Data (Schema)

Structured data helps Google understand content:
- LocalBusiness (for local businesses)
- Organization (company data)
- Article (for blogs)
- FAQ (for Q&A sections)
- BreadcrumbList (navigation)

### 13. Internal Links

Connect pages to each other:
- From each page link to related content
- Anchor text describing linked page
- Menu and breadcrumbs
- Links in article content

### 14. 404 Page

Prepare an error page:
- Clear message that page doesn't exist
- Link to homepage
- Search (optionally)
- Most important links

## Tools for Checking

### Before Launch:

- **Google Search Console** – create account and verify domain
- **PageSpeed Insights** – check speed
- **Mobile-Friendly Test** – check mobile version
- **Screaming Frog** – technical audit (free up to 500 URLs)

### After Launch:

- **Google Analytics 4** – track traffic and user behavior
- **Search Console** – monitor indexing and rankings

## Common Launch Mistakes

### Launching Development Site

Test site (e.g., dev.yourcompany.com) gets indexed as main.

**Solution:** Block dev site in robots.txt, remove before production launch.

### Duplicate Content

Same content under different URLs:
- yourcompany.com
- www.yourcompany.com
- yourcompany.com/index.html

**Solution:** 301 redirects and canonical tags.

### No Redirects From Old Site

If you have a new site replacing old one, redirect old URLs to new ones (301 redirect).

## Summary

SEO before launch is the foundation:

1. **URL structure** – readable and logical
2. **Meta tags** – optimized titles and descriptions
3. **Content** – valuable with keywords
4. **Technical** – speed, mobile, SSL
5. **Tools** – Search Console, Analytics ready

A site prepared for SEO starts with an advantage. A site without preparation chases competition for months.
