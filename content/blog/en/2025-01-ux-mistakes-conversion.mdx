The website looks great. Colors match, photos are nice, everything displays properly. But no one fills out forms, and the phone stays silent.

The problem? Probably UX. In this article, I'll show you 10 common UX mistakes I see on business websites – and how to fix them.

## Mistake #1: Unclear Hero Message

User lands on the site and sees: "Innovative solutions for your business."

What does that mean? Nothing. The user doesn't know what you do, who you help, or what problem you solve.

**How to fix:**
Use the formula: "I help [who] achieve [what] through [how]"

**Example:** "We create websites that generate inquiries for small and medium businesses"

## Mistake #2: Hidden or Unclear CTA

The "Contact" button somewhere in the footer, small font, in the background color. User wants to contact you but doesn't know how.

**How to fix:**
- CTA in contrasting color
- Repeated several times on the page
- Specific text ("Book a free consultation", not "Submit")

## Mistake #3: Form Too Long

A form with 10 fields? No one will fill it out. Each additional field reduces conversion by 7-10%.

**How to fix:**
- Minimum fields (name + email or phone)
- Collect the rest after first contact
- Remove optional fields that no one fills out anyway

## Mistake #4: No Information Hierarchy

Everything on the page is equally important = nothing is important. User doesn't know what to focus on.

**How to fix:**
- Headlines of different sizes
- Most important information at the top
- White space separating sections
- One main CTA per section

## Mistake #5: Non-intuitive Navigation

Menu with 15 items, dropdown within dropdown, category names that mean nothing.

**How to fix:**
- Maximum 5-7 items in main menu
- Clear, understandable names
- Logical structure (user shouldn't have to think)
- Breadcrumbs on subpages

## Mistake #6: No User Feedback

User clicks a button and... nothing. Did the form submit? Is the page loading? Unknown.

**How to fix:**
- Message after form submission
- Loading animation for long actions
- Clear button states (hover, active, disabled)
- Email confirmation

## Mistake #7: Ignoring Mobile Devices

The site looks great on the designer's 27-inch monitor. On phone? Text too small, buttons impossible to click, forms unusable.

**How to fix:**
- Design mobile-first
- Test on real devices
- Buttons min. 44x44px on mobile
- Text min. 16px

## Mistake #8: Slow Loading

Every second of delay = 7% less conversion. Users are impatient, and a slow site signals lack of professionalism.

**How to fix:**
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Minimize JavaScript
- Fast hosting
- CDN for static assets

## Mistake #9: Distracting Elements

Slider in hero, newsletter popup, chatbot appearing after one second, push notifications, autoplay video. All at once.

**How to fix:**
- One goal per page
- Popup only after 30+ seconds
- Chatbot in corner, not as popup
- Video only on demand

## Mistake #10: Lack of Trust

The site looks like a thousand others. Stock photos, no testimonials, no portfolio, no proof of competence.

**How to fix:**
- Real client testimonials
- Portfolio with specific projects
- Your photo / team photo
- Partner company logos
- Case studies with results

## How to Find UX Errors on Your Site?

### 5-Second Test

Show the site to a stranger for 5 seconds. Ask:
- What does this company do?
- What can you do here?
- Would you trust this site?

### User Observation

Ask someone to complete a task ("find pricing", "send inquiry"). Watch where they get lost.

### Heatmaps and Recordings

Tools like Hotjar show:
- Where users click
- How far they scroll
- Where they stop

### Data Analysis

Google Analytics shows:
- Bounce rate
- Average time on page
- Exit pages
- Conversion paths

## Prioritizing Fixes

You don't have to fix everything at once. Start with:

1. **Speed** – if the site loads slowly, nothing else matters
2. **Hero and CTA** – if the message is unclear, users leave
3. **Mobile** – if the site doesn't work on phone, you lose 60% of traffic
4. **Form** – if it's too long, no one will fill it out

## Summary

UX mistakes are a silent conversion killer. A site can look professional yet generate no inquiries – because users:

- Don't understand what you do
- Can't see where to click
- Can't use it comfortably on phone
- Have no reason to trust you

By fixing these mistakes, you can significantly increase conversion – often without changing the design.
