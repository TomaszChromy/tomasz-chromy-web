"The website looks great, but no one clicks the contact button."

I hear this regularly. Company invested in beautiful design, but the site doesn't generate leads. Why? Because they confused UI with UX.

In this article, I'll explain the difference between these concepts and show how to design websites that are both beautiful and effective.

## What Is UX and What Is UI?

### UX (User Experience) – User Experience

UX answers the question: **How easily and pleasantly does the user achieve their goal?**

It's logic, structure, information flow. UX determines:
- Whether user finds what they're looking for
- Whether they understand what to do
- Whether the process is intuitive
- Whether they don't get frustrated while using it

### UI (User Interface) – User Interface

UI answers the question: **How does it look?**

It's the visual layer: colors, typography, buttons, icons, animations. UI determines:
- Whether site looks professional
- Whether it's visually consistent
- Whether buttons are visible
- Whether aesthetics match the brand

### Restaurant Analogy

- **UX** = menu, service, table layout, wait time
- **UI** = interior design, dishes, food presentation

You can have beautiful interior, but if the waiter is rude and you wait an hour for food – will you return?

## Why Must Both Layers Work Together?

**Beautiful site with poor UX:**
- User admires design but doesn't know where to click
- Gets frustrated and leaves
- Returns to Google results and chooses competition

**Great UX with poor UI:**
- Site works logically but looks amateur
- User doesn't trust the brand
- Doesn't leave data, doesn't buy

**Ideal:** Site that's both intuitive and professional.

## Principles of Good UX

### 1. Clear Information Hierarchy

Users scan pages in **F** or **Z** pattern. Most important information must be:
- At top of page
- On left side
- Visually highlighted

### 2. Three-Click Rule

User should reach any information in **maximum 3 clicks**. If they need to search longer – something's wrong with structure.

### 3. Conventions, Not Innovations

Users have learned patterns:
- Logo in top left corner
- Menu at top or left
- Search with magnifying glass icon
- Cart in top right corner

Don't reinvent the wheel. Innovative layout = innovative frustration.

### 4. Clear CTA

User must know what to do. CTA button should:
- Be visible (contrasting color)
- Have clear text (what happens after clicking)
- Be repeated in key places

### 5. Loading Speed

Slow site = bad UX. Period.

Optimize images, minimize code, use fast hosting.

## Principles of Good UI

### 1. Visual Consistency

Use consistently:
- Same color palette (2-3 main colors)
- Same fonts (1-2 families)
- Same icon style
- Same spacing and margins

### 2. White Space

Don't fear emptiness. White space:
- Makes reading easier
- Guides the eye
- Makes site look modern

### 3. Readable Typography

- Text size: minimum 16px on desktop, 18px on mobile
- Line length: 50-75 characters
- Contrast: dark text on light background (or reverse)
- Line height: 1.5-1.8 for body text

### 4. Contrasting Buttons

Main button (CTA) must stand out from page background. If page is blue, button can be orange.

### 5. Responsiveness

Site must look good on:
- Large monitors (1920px+)
- Laptops (1366px)
- Tablets (768px)
- Phones (375px)

## How to Test UX?

### 5-Second Test

Show site to someone for 5 seconds. Ask:
- What does this company do?
- What can you do here?

### User Observation

Ask someone to complete a task on site (e.g., "find pricing"). Watch where they search, where they stop, where they get lost.

### Heatmaps and Recordings

Tools like Hotjar show:
- Where users click
- How far they scroll
- Where they stop

## Most Common UX/UI Mistakes

1. **Hamburger menu on desktop** – hides navigation
2. **Hero slider** – users don't wait for next slides
3. **Popup in first second** – frustrates, closed reflexively
4. **Too small button on mobile** – hard to click
5. **Infinite scroll without return option** – user can't go back

## Summary

UX and UI are two sides of the same coin. Site must be both:
- **Functional** (easy to use, intuitive, fast)
- **Aesthetic** (professional, consistent, modern)

Aesthetics alone don't sell. Functionality alone doesn't build trust. Only combining both creates a website that really works.
