You run a small business and need a website. You Google "how much does a website cost" and get answers from $100 to $15,000. Zero specifics, all generalities.

In this article, I'll show you specifically: where to start, what it really costs, and what to watch out for to avoid wasting your budget.

## Where to Start?

### Step 1: Define the Website's Goal

Before thinking about design, answer the question: **What should your website do?**

Possible goals:
- Generate inquiries (contact form)
- Build expert image
- Present offer and portfolio
- Sell products (e-commerce)
- Inform customers (FAQ, opening hours)

**One main goal = more effective website.**

### Step 2: Research Competition

See what others in your industry are doing:
- What do their websites look like?
- What do they do well, what poorly?
- What's missing for you as a potential customer?

Don't copy, but get inspired.

### Step 3: Prepare Content

The biggest blocker when creating a website is lack of content. Prepare:
- Company description (history, mission, values)
- Service/product descriptions
- Client testimonials (if you have them)
- Photos (yours, not stock)
- Contact information

**Tip:** Record your service description on a voice recorder and transcribe it. Comes out more natural than writing directly.

## How Much Does a Website Cost?

### Option 1: DIY ($0-100/year)

**Tools:** Wix, Squarespace, WordPress.com

**Pros:**
- Low cost
- Full control
- Quick start

**Cons:**
- Requires time (10-30h)
- Often amateur result
- Limited capabilities

**For whom:** Hobby, testing an idea, very limited budget.

### Option 2: Freelancer ($500-2,000)

**Pros:**
- Professional result
- Individual approach
- Flexibility

**Cons:**
- Quality depends on contractor
- No substitutability
- Varying availability

**For whom:** Small businesses with specific budget.

### Option 3: Agency ($2,000-7,500+)

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive service
- Guarantees and SLA
- Team of specialists

**Cons:**
- Higher cost
- Longer delivery time
- Less flexibility

**For whom:** Companies with larger requirements and budget.

## Hidden Costs No One Talks About

### Domain ($10-50/year)
Your website address (e.g., yourcompany.com). Annual cost.

### Hosting ($50-250/year)
Server where the site lives. Cheap hosting = slow site.

### SSL Certificate ($0-100/year)
Most hosts provide free (Let's Encrypt).

### Updates and Maintenance ($100-500/year)
WordPress requires updates. You can do it yourself or pay someone.

### Photos and Graphics ($0-500)
Professional photo session makes a difference.

### Copywriting ($100-750)
If you don't write yourself – it costs.

## What to Avoid With Your First Website?

### 1. The Cheapest Offer

"$100 for a website" usually means:
- Ready template with minimal customization
- No SEO optimization
- Zero post-launch support

**Remember:** Website should earn money, not just look nice.

### 2. Over-building

You don't need:
- 15 pages to start
- Blog (if you won't write)
- Store (if you sell services)
- Advanced animations

**Start with minimum, expand as needed.**

### 3. Building Without Strategy

Website is a tool. First define:
- Who is your customer?
- What problem do they have?
- How do you help them?

Then design the website.

### 4. Stock Photos of Smiling People

Everyone's seen them. They build nothing. Better one photo of you than ten from stock.

## Minimum That Works

For a small service business, you need:

1. **Homepage** – who, what, for whom, CTA
2. **Services** – what you offer, what benefits
3. **About Me/Company** – your story, photo
4. **Contact** – form, details, map

That's 4 pages. Not 40.

## How Long Does It Take to Create a Website?

**Realistic timelines:**
- Simple site (freelancer): 2-4 weeks
- Complex site (agency): 4-8 weeks
- E-commerce: 6-12 weeks

**Note:** This is time from start to publication. Add time for content preparation (usually your responsibility).

## How to Choose a Developer?

### Check Portfolio
Have they made sites in similar style/industry?

### Read Reviews
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn – what do clients say?

### Have a Conversation
Do they understand your business? Do they ask about goals, not just design?

### Agree on Scope in Writing
What's included in price? How many revisions? Who provides content?

## Summary

A website for a small business doesn't have to cost a fortune, but shouldn't be the cheapest either.

**Realistic budget for small business:**
- **$750-2,000** for a site with freelancer
- **+ $100-250/year** for hosting, domain, maintenance

**Key steps:**
1. Define website goal
2. Prepare content and photos
3. Choose developer based on portfolio and conversation
4. Start with minimum, expand later
