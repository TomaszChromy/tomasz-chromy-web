"$2,000 for a website? That's a lot." I hear this regularly. And I understand – for a small business, every expense is significant.

But the question shouldn't be "how much does it cost?" but "how much will it bring?" In this article, I'll show you how to view a website as an investment, not a cost.

## Cost vs Investment – What's the Difference?

### Cost:
You spend money, nothing comes back. Like an electricity bill.

### Investment:
You spend money to earn more. Like hiring a salesperson.

A website can be either – depends on how you build it.

**Website-as-cost:** Business card that does nothing. You spent money, have a nice site, zero inquiries.

**Website-as-investment:** Sales tool that generates customers. You spent money, but it comes back with interest.

## How to Calculate Return on Investment (ROI)?

### Simple Formula:

**ROI = (Revenue from website - Website cost) / Website cost × 100%**

### Example:

- Website cost: $2,000
- Website generates 3 inquiries/month
- Inquiry conversion: 30%
- Average customer value: $1,250

**In one year:**
- 36 inquiries
- 11 customers (30% conversion)
- $13,750 revenue

**ROI = ($13,750 - $2,000) / $2,000 × 100% = 587%**

That's 587% return in the first year. And the website keeps working.

## "But My Website Doesn't Generate Inquiries"

This is the most common problem. And the main reason people think of websites as costs.

### Why Doesn't the Website Generate Inquiries?

**1. No Traffic**
Website exists, but no one visits.
- Solution: SEO, ads, social media

**2. Traffic Exists, No Conversion**
People come and leave.
- Solution: better CTA, content, social proof

**3. Wrong Traffic**
People who aren't your customers are coming.
- Solution: better targeting, content marketing

## How Much Is a Good Website Worth?

### Compare With Other Customer Acquisition Methods:

**Salesperson:**
- Cost: $1,500-4,000/month (salary + overhead)
- Acquires: 5-20 customers/month
- Cost per customer: $125-750

**Google Ads:**
- Cost: $500-2,500/month
- Acquires: depends on industry
- Cost per customer: $25-250

**Website (one-time investment):**
- Cost: $2,000 (one-time)
- Acquires: 2-10 customers/month (with good traffic)
- Cost per customer: decreases over time

### Key Difference:
Salesperson and ads are recurring costs. Website is a one-time investment that works for years.

## Hidden Benefits of a Good Website

### 1. Credibility

Professional website builds trust. Customer who checks you on Google and sees a good site is more likely to buy.

### 2. Shorter Sales Cycle

Customer who read the site, knows the offer, saw the portfolio – you don't need to explain everything from scratch.

### 3. Better Quality Inquiries

Website with prices and details filters customers. Those who really fit come through.

### 4. Time Savings

Instead of explaining the same thing to everyone – send a link. FAQ answers typical questions.

### 5. Scalability

Website handles unlimited visitors. Salesperson has a limit.

## When Is a Website NOT a Good Investment?

### 1. When You Have Nothing to Sell

Unclear offer, no competitiveness – website won't solve fundamental business problems.

### 2. When You Won't Invest in Traffic

Website without traffic = website without customers. You must plan SEO, ads, or other sources.

### 3. When You Build a "Business Card"

Website without goals, without CTA, without optimization – that's a cost, not investment.

## How to Maximize Website ROI?

### 1. Define Goals Before Building

What should the website do? How many inquiries per month do you want?

### 2. Invest in Content

Good copy converts. Bad copy wastes traffic.

### 3. Plan Traffic Sources

SEO, ads, social media – where will visitors come from?

### 4. Measure and Optimize

Google Analytics, goals, conversions. Data shows what to improve.

### 5. Don't Save on the Wrong Things

A $100 website may cost more through lost opportunities.

## Summary

A website is:

**Cost** – when you make a business card without goals, without traffic, without optimization.

**Investment** – when you build a sales tool with clear goal, traffic, and effect measurement.

The difference? Mindset and a few key decisions.

A good website for $2,000 that generates $12,500 annually isn't a cost – it's the best investment you can make.
