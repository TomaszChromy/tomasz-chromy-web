Through years of client conversations, I see how many myths circulate about websites. These beliefs lead to bad decisions – wasted budgets, unrealistic expectations, and disappointments.

Time to debunk them.

## Myth #1: "More Expensive = Better"

### The myth:
The more you pay, the better website you'll get.

### The truth:
Price doesn't guarantee quality. An agency charging $7,500 can make a worse site than a freelancer charging $2,000.

**What you pay higher price for:**
- Larger team (more people = more costs)
- Company overhead
- Expensive office
- Agency brand

**What actually matters:**
- Portfolio and experience
- Understanding your business
- Quality of process
- Post-launch support

## Myth #2: "Website Will Sell Itself"

### The myth:
Launch the website and clients start calling.

### The truth:
A website alone does nothing. You need traffic.

**Website is a conversion tool:**
- Convinces people who already arrived
- Doesn't attract traffic by itself (unless SEO)

**For website to work:**
- SEO – traffic from Google (3-12 months)
- Ads – paid traffic immediately
- Social media – building reach
- Referrals – networking, partnerships

## Myth #3: "Build Once and Forget"

### The myth:
A website is a one-time investment. Build it once and it works for years.

### The truth:
A website requires regular attention.

**Minimum:**
- Technical updates (security)
- Domain and hosting renewal
- Bug fixes

**Ideal:**
- Content updates
- New work in portfolio
- Blog with new articles
- Analysis and optimization

A neglected site with "Copyright 2019" and empty blog hurts your image.

## Myth #4: "Can Have Everything: Cheap, Fast, and Good"

### The myth:
You can make a professional website for $100 in a week.

### The truth:
You can have two of three. Not all three.

**Cheap and fast:** Template with minimal customization
**Cheap and good:** Long delivery time (hobby project)
**Fast and good:** Higher price

## Myth #5: "Clients Read the Entire Page"

### The myth:
People enter a site and read from beginning to end.

### The truth:
People scan. First 5 seconds decide if they stay.

**How they actually read:**
- Headlines
- Bold text
- Lists
- Images
- CTAs

**Conclusion:**
Structure and scannability are more important than beautiful prose.

## Myth #6: "Website Must Be Original and Unique"

### The myth:
Website must look different from all others.

### The truth:
Conventions exist because they work.

**Users expect:**
- Logo in top left corner
- Menu at top
- Contact in top right and footer
- CTA in contrasting color

**Originality at the cost of usability = bad originality.**

Be original in content and offer, not in page layout.

## Myth #7: "SEO Is Black Magic"

### The myth:
SEO is secret knowledge for the initiated.

### The truth:
SEO basics are simple. Advanced SEO requires knowledge, but isn't magic.

**Basics anyone can do:**
- Page titles with keywords
- Meta descriptions
- H1, H2, H3 headings
- Fast loading
- Responsiveness

**What needs an expert:**
- Keyword strategy
- Link building
- Technical SEO
- Competition analysis

## Myth #8: "Important That I Like the Website"

### The myth:
Website is good if the owner likes it.

### The truth:
Website should appeal to customers and convince them.

**Your preferences vs customer needs:**
- You like dark colors? Customers may prefer light.
- Don't want to show prices? Customers want to know them.
- Want animations? Customers want speed.

A website is a business tool, not a personal gallery.

## Myth #9: "WordPress/Wix/Squarespace – All the Same"

### The myth:
Platform doesn't matter, they're all the same.

### The truth:
Platform matters – different tools for different needs.

**WordPress:**
- Flexible, scalable
- Requires maintenance
- Great for larger sites

**Wix/Squarespace:**
- Easy start
- Limited capabilities
- Often poor SEO

**Next.js/Headless:**
- Fastest
- Needs a developer
- Great for performance

## Myth #10: "Animations and Effects = Professionalism"

### The myth:
Lots of animations, parallax, effects – that's a professional site.

### The truth:
Excessive effects slow down the site and distract.

**Professionalism means:**
- Readability and clarity
- Fast loading
- Clear communication
- Easy navigation

**Animations are OK when:**
- Subtle and purposeful
- Don't slow down the site
- Guide the eye

## Myth #11: "Design First, Content Later"

### The myth:
Order design, you'll add content later.

### The truth:
Content should come before design.

**Why:**
- Design adapts to content, not the other way around
- Lorem ipsum doesn't show real proportions
- Changing content = changing layout

**Ideal order:**
1. Strategy and site goal
2. Content (texts, photos)
3. Design
4. Development

## Summary

**Myths to abandon:**
- More expensive = better
- Build once and forget
- Can have cheap, fast, and good
- Clients read everything
- SEO is magic

**Truths to accept:**
- Website needs traffic and maintenance
- Simplicity and conventions work
- Content is more important than design
- Website should work for customers, not for you

Conscious approach saves money and stress.
