"Website or social media?" – this is one of the most common questions I hear from small business owners. Budget is limited, time too. Where to invest?

The answer isn't simple because it depends on your business. In this article, I'll help you make the right decision.

## Website – Pros and Cons

### Pros

**Full Control**
The website is yours. No one will take it away, change the algorithm, or block your account.

**Professional Image**
A company without a website in 2025? For many customers, that's a red flag.

**SEO and Organic Traffic**
Website can attract traffic from Google – for free, for years.

**Content Ownership**
Everything you publish stays on your site. Doesn't disappear after 24h.

**Better Conversions**
Dedicated landing page converts better than a Facebook profile.

### Cons

**Initial Cost**
Professional website is an investment of $750-4,000 or more.

**Delivery Time**
2-8 weeks to create a good website.

**Requires Traffic**
Website alone doesn't generate traffic – you need to bring it (SEO, Ads, social).

**Maintenance**
Hosting, domain, updates, fixes.

## Social Media – Pros and Cons

### Pros

**Low Entry Barrier**
You can create an Instagram account in 5 minutes. For free.

**Immediate Reach**
You can reach people from day one.

**Customer Interaction**
Comments, messages, building relationships.

**Currency**
Easy to show the company is alive and active.

**Viral Potential**
Good content can spread organically.

### Cons

**No Control**
Platform can change algorithm, rules, or block account. Just like that.

**Content Temporality**
Post from a week ago? No one will see it. Content must be constantly new.

**Algorithm Race**
You must publish regularly, otherwise reach drops.

**Distraction**
User scrolls, has 1000 distractions. Hard to convert.

**Building on Rented Land**
You create value for the platform, not for yourself.

## When to Choose Website?

### 1. When You Offer B2B Services

Companies look for service providers on Google, not TikTok.
- Website builds professional image
- SEO attracts actively searching customers
- Portfolio and case studies convince

### 2. When Customers Search for You on Google

Plumber, lawyer, photographer, web design – people type this into search.

### 3. When You Need Landing Page for Campaigns

Ad leads to dedicated landing page, not Facebook profile.

### 4. When You Want to Build Long-Term

SEO gives results for years. Instagram post lives 24-48h.

### 5. When Credibility Matters

For many customers, company without website = company that doesn't really exist.

## When to Choose Social Media?

### 1. When Your Customers Are Active There

- Fashion, beauty, fitness → Instagram
- B2B, experts → LinkedIn
- Younger consumers → TikTok
- Local community → Facebook

### 2. When You Sell Visual Products

Jewelry, clothes, food, interiors – Instagram is a natural channel.

### 3. When You're Just Starting With No Budget

Social media lets you build audience without website investment.

### 4. When Quick Contact Matters

Instagram DM is faster than contact form.

### 5. When Building Personal Brand

Trainers, coaches, experts – personal branding works great on social.

## Maybe Both?

The best strategy for most companies is a **combination**:

**Website as Base:**
- Presents offer
- Builds trust (portfolio, testimonials)
- Generates leads (forms)
- Ranks in Google (SEO)

**Social Media as Channel:**
- Drives traffic to website
- Builds relationship with audience
- Shows company is alive
- Supports brand recognition

### Example Flow:

1. **Social media** – user discovers you on Instagram
2. **Website** – visits site, reads offer, sees portfolio
3. **Form** – fills out inquiry
4. **Email** – you receive a lead

## Budget and Priorities

### You Have $750-1,250 and Starting

**Option A:** Simple website + basic social media
**Option B:** Strong social media + simple landing page

### You Have $1,250-4,000

Professional website + consistent social media

### You Have Limited Time

- Social media requires regularity (3-5 posts/week)
- Website requires more at start, less later

## What You Lose Without a Website?

- **Credibility** – for many customers, company without website doesn't exist
- **SEO** – free traffic from Google
- **Control** – you're dependent on platform
- **Conversions** – landing page converts better than profile

## What You Lose Without Social Media?

- **Currency** – customers don't see you're active
- **Relationship** – no interaction with audience
- **Quick Contact** – DM is more convenient for many
- **Reach** – organic traffic from platform

## My Recommendation

### Minimum for Every Company:

1. **Website** – even simple, but professional
2. **Google Business Profile** – free, crucial for local SEO
3. **One social media channel** – where your customers are

### Ideally:

- SEO-optimized website
- Blog with valuable content
- 1-2 social media channels run consistently
- Email marketing to build list

## Summary

**Website:**
- Control, SEO, credibility
- Requires initial investment
- Works long-term

**Social Media:**
- Quick start, interaction, reach
- Requires regularity
- Building on rented land

For most companies, the best answer is: **both** – website as foundation, social as channel.
