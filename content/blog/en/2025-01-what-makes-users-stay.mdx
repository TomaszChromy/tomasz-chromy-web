A user lands on your website. After 3 seconds, they either stay or click "back" and choose the competition. This moment decides everything – and you don't get a second chance.

In this article, I'll show you exactly what influences this decision and how to design a website that keeps visitors.

## Psychology of the First Seconds

### First Impression Effect

Studies show that users judge a website's credibility in **0.05 seconds** – before reading a single word. This assessment is based on:

- Overall appearance (professional vs amateur)
- Page layout (organized vs chaotic)
- Colors and typography
- Loading speed

### What Happens in the User's Mind?

They subconsciously ask three questions:

1. **"Did I land in the right place?"** – Does what I see match what I was looking for?
2. **"Can I trust this?"** – Does this site look professional?
3. **"What should I do now?"** – Do I know what the next step is?

If the answer to any question is "no" – the user leaves.

## Factors That Keep Users

### 1. Loading Speed

This is the most important technical factor. Every second of delay:
- Reduces conversion by 7%
- Increases bounce rate by 11%
- Worsens Google ranking

**Goal:** The site should load in less than 3 seconds.

### 2. Clear Hero Message

The top of the page must immediately answer: "What do you do and how can you help me?"

**Wrong:**
- "Welcome to our website"
- "Comprehensive solutions for your business"
- List of technologies and certificates

**Right:**
- "We create websites that generate client inquiries"
- "I help small businesses sell more online"

### 3. Consistency with Expectations

If a user clicked an ad promising "free website quote", they must immediately see the quote form – not a general homepage.

**Rule:** The landing page must fulfill the promise that attracted the user.

### 4. Visual Hierarchy

The user's eye scans the page in predictable patterns (F or Z pattern). The most important elements must be:
- At the top of the page
- On the left side
- Visually highlighted (size, color, contrast)

### 5. Readability and Order

Chaotic site = quick exit. Users need:
- White space
- Logical structure
- Readable typography
- Consistent colors

### 6. Mobile Experience

Over 60% of users browse on phones. If your site:
- Is unreadable on small screens
- Has buttons too small to tap
- Loads slowly on mobile networks

...you're losing most of your traffic.

## Factors That Repel Users

### 1. Popups in the First Second

Nothing is more irritating than a popup appearing before you can read anything. Newsletter? Chatbot? Promotion? – Wait at least 30 seconds.

### 2. Autoplay Video with Sound

User is at work, on the bus, at night next to sleeping partner. Suddenly music blares. They close the site and never return.

### 3. Information Overload

The homepage is not an encyclopedia. Trying to show everything at once creates chaos that paralyzes users.

### 4. No Clear CTA

User is interested but doesn't know what to do. Can't see the button. Doesn't know where to click. Leaves.

### 5. Outdated Information

Copyright © 2019, last blog post from 3 years ago, broken links. User thinks: "Does this company still exist?"

### 6. Stock Photos

Smiling people in suits at a laptop. Everyone's seen them. They don't build trust – they're ignored.

## How to Measure If Your Site Keeps Users?

### Bounce Rate

Percentage of users who entered the site and left without interaction.
- **Below 40%** – good
- **40-60%** – needs improvement
- **Above 60%** – problem

### Average Time on Page

How long users spend on the page.
- **Above 2 minutes** – content engages
- **Below 30 seconds** – something's wrong

### Scroll Depth

How far users scroll. If 90% leave after the first screen – hero isn't working.

### Heatmaps

Tools like Hotjar show where users click and how they move around the page.

## Practical Checklist

Review your site and check:

- [ ] Does it load in less than 3 seconds?
- [ ] Is it clear within 5 seconds what I do?
- [ ] Is there a clear CTA?
- [ ] Does the site look good on mobile?
- [ ] Are there no popups in the first seconds?
- [ ] Is the information current?
- [ ] Are photos authentic (not stock)?
- [ ] Is the structure clear and organized?

## Summary

Users decide whether to stay on a site within 3-5 seconds. In that time, they assess:

- **Speed** – did the site load
- **Relevance** – did I land in the right place
- **Trust** – does this site look professional
- **Direction** – do I know what to do next

You can control each of these elements. The question is, are you?
