You invested in a website, it looks great, but when you type your company name in Google... nothing. The site doesn't exist for search engines.

This is one of the most common problems clients bring to me. In this article, I'll explain why this happens and how to fix it.

## How Does Google Find Websites?

Before we get to problems, let's understand the process:

1. **Crawling** – Google's robots (Googlebot) browse the internet, following links
2. **Indexing** – Google analyzes found pages and adds them to its index
3. **Ranking** – when someone searches, Google selects the best results from the index

Problems can occur at any of these stages.

## Cause #1: Website Not Indexed

### How to check?

Type in Google: `site:yourdomain.com`

If there are no results – the site is not in the index.

### Possible causes:

**Website is new**
Google needs time (days to weeks) to find and index a new site.

**No links pointing to the site**
If no other site links to yours, Googlebot may not find it.

**Block in robots.txt**
The robots.txt file may block Google's access.

**Noindex tag**
The page code may contain a hidden tag `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` telling Google: "don't index me."

### How to fix?

1. Register the site in Google Search Console
2. Submit sitemap.xml
3. Check robots.txt and remove blocks
4. Check page code for noindex tag
5. Get a link from another site (e.g., business profile, directory)

## Cause #2: Website Indexed, But Ranking Low

The site is in Google, but on page 5, 10, or further. No one gets there.

### Possible causes:

**Lack of SEO optimization**
- No keywords in titles and headings
- Too little content
- No meta description

**Poor content quality**
- Content copied from other sites
- Too short texts
- No value for user

**Competition is stronger**
In some industries, competition for main phrases is enormous.

**Technical problems**
- Slow loading
- No mobile version
- Code errors

### How to fix?

1. Conduct an SEO audit
2. Optimize titles and headings
3. Expand content (min. 500-1000 words per page)
4. Improve loading speed
5. Ensure mobile version works

## Cause #3: Technical Problems

### No HTTPS (SSL)

Google prefers secure sites. No SSL means:
- Lower positions in results
- "Not secure" warning in browser
- Signal that repels users

### Slow Loading

Core Web Vitals is an official ranking factor. Slow sites drop in results.

**Check:** PageSpeed Insights (pagespeed.web.dev)

### No Responsiveness

For years, Google uses mobile-first indexing – it checks the mobile version first.

### 404 Errors and Redirects

Broken links and wrong redirects signal neglect.

## Cause #4: Website Too New or Too Small

### New Domain

New domains must "earn" trust. This takes 3-6 months.

### Too Little Content

A site with 3 subpages has less chance than a competitor with 50.

**Solution:** Blog, FAQ section, expanded service descriptions.

## Cause #5: Google Penalty

Rare, but it happens. Google can penalize a site for:
- Buying links
- Hidden text
- Duplicate content
- Spam

**How to check:** Google Search Console → Manual Actions

## What to Do Step by Step?

### 1. Set Up Google Search Console

Free tool from Google. Shows:
- Whether site is indexed
- What errors Googlebot detects
- What phrases you appear for

### 2. Submit Sitemap

Sitemap.xml is your site map for Google. Most CMS generate it automatically.

### 3. Check robots.txt

File at yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Should not block important pages.

### 4. Check Noindex Tag

In source code, search for `noindex`. Should not be on pages you want indexed.

### 5. Fix SEO Basics

- Page titles (title tag) with key phrases
- Meta description encouraging clicks
- H1, H2, H3 headings with keywords
- Image alt text

### 6. Expand Content

Each important subpage should have min. 300-500 words of valuable content.

### 7. Get Links

Links from other sites are a trust signal for Google:
- Google Business Profile
- Industry directories
- Partnerships and collaborations
- Guest posting

## How Long to Appear in Google?

- **New site:** 1-4 weeks for indexing
- **Positions for main phrases:** 3-6 months
- **Stable, high positions:** 6-12 months

SEO is a marathon, not a sprint.

## Summary

If your website doesn't appear in Google, check:

1. **Is it indexed?** (site:yourdomain.com)
2. **Are there blocks?** (robots.txt, noindex)
3. **Is it optimized?** (titles, content, speed)
4. **Does it have links from other sites?**

Most problems can be fixed – just need diagnosis and patience.
