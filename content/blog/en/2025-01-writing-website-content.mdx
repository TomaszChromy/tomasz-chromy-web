A website can look great, but if the texts are weak – no one will buy. Content is the most important element of a converting website. In this article, I'll show you how to write texts that convince and sell.

## Why Content Is More Important Than Design?

Design attracts the eye. Content convinces.

**Pretty website with weak texts:** "Looks nice, but I don't understand what they offer."

**Average website with good texts:** "That's exactly what I'm looking for. I'm reaching out."

People buy when they understand the offer and see the benefit.

## Rule #1: Write to the Customer, Not About Yourself

### Mistake:
> "We are industry leaders with 20 years of experience. We offer comprehensive business solutions."

### Better:
> "Your website doesn't generate inquiries? We'll build a site that works for your business 24/7."

The customer doesn't care who you are. They care what they'll gain.

### Replace "we" with "you":
- ~~We offer~~ → You'll receive
- ~~We are~~ → Your company will be
- ~~We have experience~~ → Thanks to our experience, you...

## Rule #2: Features → Benefits

Feature is what you do. Benefit is what customer gains.

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Responsive design | Your customers buy easily from their phones |
| Fast hosting | Site loads instantly – no one waits |
| SEO optimization | Customers find you on Google themselves |
| CMS | You edit content yourself without calling IT |

### Formula:
**[Feature], which means [benefit].**

"Site optimized for SEO, which means customers find you on Google themselves."

## Rule #3: Specific Instead of General

### General (weak):
> "Comprehensive solutions for your business."

### Specific (strong):
> "We create websites for small service businesses – from plumbers to lawyers."

Specifics build trust. Generalities sound like empty marketing.

### Examples of specifics:
- Numbers: "50+ completed projects"
- Time: "Website ready in 3 weeks"
- Results: "150% increase in inquiries"
- Names: "For XYZ Law Firm"

## Rule #4: Structure That Guides

No one reads cover to cover. People scan.

### Heading hierarchy:
- **H1:** Main page message
- **H2:** Sections (benefits, how we work, portfolio)
- **H3:** Sub-points

### Short paragraphs:
- 2-4 sentences
- One thought per paragraph
- Spacing between paragraphs

### Lists and bullets:
Easier to scan than text blocks.

### Bold text:
Highlights key information.

## Rule #5: Hero That Convinces in 5 Seconds

Hero is the first thing users see. Has 5 seconds to convince.

### Elements of good hero:

**Headline (H1):**
- Clear message: what you do and for whom
- Benefit for customer
- Max 10-12 words

**Subheadline:**
- Expands on headline
- Additional benefit or explanation

**CTA:**
- Button with specific action
- "Book a free consultation" instead of "Learn more"

## Rule #6: Proof, Not Promises

Anyone can write "we're the best." Proof convinces.

### Client testimonials:
- Name, company, position
- Specific result ("50% increase in inquiries")
- Photo (builds credibility)

### Case studies:
- Client's problem
- What we did
- What was the result

### Numbers:
- "50+ completed projects"
- "5/5 average rating from 20 reviews"
- "Creating websites since 2018"

## Rule #7: One CTA, Repeated Many Times

User must know what to do.

### Where to place CTA:
- In hero (at top)
- After benefits section
- After portfolio/testimonials
- At page end
- In sticky header (optionally)

### How to write CTA:
- Specific: "Book consultation" instead of "Click"
- With benefit: "Download free guide"
- Urgency (optional): "Only 5 spots left"

## Rule #8: Answer Objections

Customer has doubts. Address them before they ask.

### Typical objections:
- "How much does it cost?" → Pricing section or "from $X"
- "Will it work for me?" → Case studies from similar industry
- "Can I trust you?" → Testimonials, portfolio, your face
- "What if it fails?" → Guarantee, process, support

### FAQ:
Q&A section clears doubts.

## Checklist for Good Text

- [ ] Writing to customer, not about myself
- [ ] Converting features to benefits
- [ ] Using specifics instead of generalities
- [ ] Text divided into short paragraphs
- [ ] Headlines are clear and informative
- [ ] There's proof (testimonials, case studies, numbers)
- [ ] CTA is clear and repeated
- [ ] Answering main objections

## Summary

Content that sells:

1. **Customer-focused** – what they gain, not who you are
2. **Specific** – numbers, results, names
3. **Organized** – easy to scan
4. **Credible** – testimonials, case studies, proof
5. **With clear CTA** – user knows what to do

Good text converts visitors into customers. Bad text – wastes traffic.
