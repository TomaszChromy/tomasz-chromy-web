Transparency is key to successful projects. Here's exactly what happens when we work together - from the first conversation to launch day and beyond.

## Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1)

Every project starts with understanding. During our initial call, I'll ask about:

- Your business goals - what should this website achieve?
- Your target audience - who are you trying to reach?
- Your competitors - what are they doing well or poorly?
- Your timeline and budget - let's be realistic from the start

After this call, I create a detailed proposal including scope, timeline, and investment. No surprises later.

## Phase 2: Design (Weeks 2-3)

Once we agree on the scope, I start with wireframes - simple layouts that show structure without visual design. This helps us nail the user flow before investing in detailed design.

After wireframe approval, I create high-fidelity mockups in Figma. You'll see exactly how your site will look on desktop and mobile. We iterate until you're completely happy.

## Phase 3: Development (Weeks 3-5)

This is where designs become reality. I build with modern technologies:

- **React / Next.js** for the front-end
- **TypeScript** for type-safe, maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, custom styling
- **Headless CMS** for easy content management

Throughout development, you'll have access to a staging site where you can see progress and provide feedback.

## Phase 4: Review & Testing (Week 5-6)

Before launch, we thoroughly test:

- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness on real devices
- Page speed and Core Web Vitals
- Forms and integrations
- SEO basics (meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt)

You'll review the final site and request any last adjustments.

## Phase 5: Launch

Launch day is exciting! I handle all technical aspects:

- Domain configuration and SSL setup
- Deployment to production
- Analytics and tracking setup
- Performance monitoring

## After Launch: Ongoing Support

The relationship doesn't end at launch. All projects include:

- 30 days of free bug fixes and minor adjustments
- Documentation for content management
- Training session on how to use your new site

I also offer monthly maintenance packages for updates, security patches, and ongoing improvements.

## Communication Throughout

You'll never wonder what's happening with your project. I provide:

- Weekly progress updates via email
- Slack/Teams access for quick questions
- Video calls for major decisions
- Clear timeline with milestones

## Ready to Start?

The first step is a free 15-minute consultation. We'll discuss your project, and I'll give you honest feedback on timeline and budget expectations.
