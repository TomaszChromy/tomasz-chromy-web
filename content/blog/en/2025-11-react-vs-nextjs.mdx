If you're planning a new web project, you've probably heard about React and Next.js. Both are excellent tools, but they serve different purposes. Let me explain when to use each one.

## What Is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Created by Facebook (now Meta), it's the most popular front-end tool in the world. React lets you build interactive, dynamic web applications using reusable components.

A "pure" React application is a Single Page Application (SPA) - the entire app loads once, and navigation happens without page refreshes.

## What Is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework built on top of React. It adds features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based routing, and API routes. Think of it as React with superpowers.

## Key Differences

### Rendering

**React (SPA):** Everything renders in the browser. The server sends a minimal HTML file, and JavaScript builds the page on the client side.

**Next.js:** Offers multiple rendering options - server-side rendering, static generation, or client-side rendering. You can even mix them within the same application.

### SEO

**React:** Challenging for SEO because search engines may not execute JavaScript properly. Requires additional configuration for good SEO.

**Next.js:** Excellent SEO out of the box. Server-rendered pages are fully visible to search engines.

### Performance

**React:** Initial load can be slow as the browser downloads and executes all JavaScript before showing content.

**Next.js:** Faster initial load with server rendering. Built-in image optimization, code splitting, and prefetching.

### Routing

**React:** Requires a third-party library like React Router.

**Next.js:** File-based routing built in. Create a file in the pages folder, and it automatically becomes a route.

## When to Choose React (SPA)

- Building a dashboard or admin panel
- Internal tools that don't need SEO
- Highly interactive applications like design tools
- When you need complete control over the architecture

## When to Choose Next.js

- Marketing websites that need good SEO
- E-commerce stores
- Blogs and content-heavy sites
- Applications that need fast initial load times
- When you want to ship faster with less configuration

## My Recommendation

For most business websites, I recommend Next.js. The SEO benefits, performance optimizations, and developer experience are hard to beat. The framework handles many complex decisions for you, letting you focus on building features.

Use pure React when you're building internal tools, dashboards, or applications where SEO doesn't matter and you need maximum flexibility.

## Conclusion

Both React and Next.js are excellent choices. Next.js is better for public-facing websites that need SEO and performance. React SPAs work great for dashboards and internal applications.

The good news? Skills transfer between them. If you know React, learning Next.js is straightforward - it's still React at its core.
