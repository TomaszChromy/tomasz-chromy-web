One of the most common questions I receive from potential clients is: "How much will my website cost?" The honest answer is: it depends. But let me break down exactly what factors influence the price and give you realistic expectations.

## Understanding Website Pricing

Website costs vary dramatically based on complexity, features, and who builds it. A simple landing page might cost €500-2,000, while a complex e-commerce platform could run €10,000-50,000 or more. Let's look at what drives these differences.

## Key Factors That Affect Price

### 1. Type of Website

**Landing page (€500-2,000):** A single-page website focused on one goal - usually lead generation or product promotion. Perfect for startups validating an idea.

**Business website (€2,000-8,000):** 5-15 pages including home, about, services, portfolio, and contact. Most small businesses fall into this category.

**E-commerce (€5,000-30,000):** Online stores with product management, payment processing, shipping integration. Price scales with number of products and features.

**Web application (€10,000+):** Custom functionality like user dashboards, booking systems, or SaaS platforms. These require significant development time.

### 2. Design Complexity

A template-based design costs less than custom design. Custom illustrations, animations, and unique layouts increase the price but also make your site stand out.

### 3. Content Requirements

Do you have ready content, or do you need copywriting? Professional photography? These add to the budget but significantly impact conversion rates.

### 4. Technical Requirements

Integrations with CRM, email marketing, payment gateways, or custom APIs all add complexity and cost.

## What You're Really Paying For

When you hire a professional developer, you're not just paying for code. You're paying for:

- **Strategy** - understanding your business goals and translating them into effective design
- **Experience** - avoiding common mistakes that could cost you customers
- **Quality** - clean code that's fast, secure, and maintainable
- **Support** - someone to call when things break or need updating

## How to Budget for Your Website

Here's my advice: think about your website as an investment, not an expense. A well-designed website that converts visitors into customers pays for itself many times over.

Start with your goals. What do you need the website to achieve? Then prioritize features based on what will have the biggest impact on those goals.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Be cautious of quotes that seem too good to be true. Extremely low prices often mean:

- Template-only solutions with no customization
- Offshore teams with communication challenges
- Hidden costs that appear later
- Poor quality code that causes problems down the road

## Conclusion

A professional business website typically costs between €2,000-8,000. E-commerce and web applications start at €5,000 and can go much higher depending on requirements.

The best approach? Have an honest conversation with a developer about your goals and budget. A good developer will help you prioritize features and find the right solution for your needs.
