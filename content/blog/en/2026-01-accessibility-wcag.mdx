Web accessibility used to be a "nice to have." In 2026, it's a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, an SEO factor, and a business advantage. If your website isn't accessible, you're excluding customers and risking lawsuits.

## What Is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use your website. This includes:

- **Visual impairments** – blindness, low vision, color blindness
- **Hearing impairments** – deafness, hard of hearing
- **Motor impairments** – difficulty using a mouse, limited fine motor control
- **Cognitive impairments** – dyslexia, ADHD, memory issues

Accessible websites work for everyone, including people using screen readers, keyboard navigation, or voice control.

## Why Accessibility Matters in 2026

### Legal Requirements

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) comes into full effect in 2025, requiring accessibility for many digital services. In the US, ADA lawsuits against inaccessible websites continue to rise.

If you do business in the EU or US, accessibility is not optional.

### SEO Benefits

Many accessibility practices align with SEO best practices:
- Proper heading structure
- Alt text for images
- Descriptive link text
- Fast loading times
- Mobile responsiveness

Google rewards accessible websites.

### Business Case

15% of the world's population has some form of disability. That's over 1 billion potential customers. An inaccessible website excludes them.

Plus, accessibility improvements often benefit everyone – better contrast helps in bright sunlight, captions help in noisy environments.

## WCAG 2.2: What You Need to Know

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is the international standard. Version 2.2 was released in 2023 and adds new criteria.

### The Four Principles (POUR)

1. **Perceivable** – Users can perceive the content (see, hear, or feel it)
2. **Operable** – Users can navigate and interact
3. **Understandable** – Content and interface are understandable
4. **Robust** – Works with assistive technologies

### Conformance Levels

- **Level A** – Minimum accessibility (basic)
- **Level AA** – Standard for most websites (recommended)
- **Level AAA** – Highest level (often impractical for entire sites)

Most regulations require Level AA compliance.

## Key WCAG 2.2 Requirements

### 1. Text Alternatives (1.1.1)

All non-text content needs text alternatives:
- Alt text for images
- Transcripts for audio
- Captions for video

### 2. Color Contrast (1.4.3)

Text must have sufficient contrast with background:
- Normal text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum
- Large text: 3:1 ratio minimum

### 3. Keyboard Navigation (2.1.1)

All functionality must be accessible via keyboard:
- Tab through interactive elements
- Enter/Space to activate
- Escape to close modals

### 4. Focus Indicators (2.4.7)

Keyboard users must see where they are:
- Visible focus outline on interactive elements
- Don't remove focus styles with `outline: none`

### 5. Form Labels (1.3.1, 3.3.2)

Forms must be properly labeled:
- Every input needs a label
- Error messages must be clear
- Required fields must be indicated

### 6. Heading Structure (1.3.1)

Use headings to create document structure:
- One H1 per page
- Logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Don't skip levels

### 7. Link Purpose (2.4.4)

Links must make sense out of context:
- ❌ "Click here"
- ✅ "Download the accessibility checklist"

## New in WCAG 2.2

### Focus Not Obscured (2.4.11)

When an element receives focus, it must not be completely hidden by other content (like sticky headers).

### Dragging Movements (2.5.7)

Any functionality that uses dragging must have an alternative (like buttons).

### Target Size (2.5.8)

Interactive elements must be at least 24x24 CSS pixels.

## How to Test Accessibility

### Automated Tools

- **axe DevTools** – Browser extension for automated testing
- **WAVE** – Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Lighthouse** – Built into Chrome DevTools

Automated tools catch about 30% of issues.

### Manual Testing

- Navigate with keyboard only (no mouse)
- Use a screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Check color contrast
- Test with zoom at 200%

### User Testing

The best test is real users with disabilities. Consider including them in your testing process.

## Implementation Checklist

✅ All images have alt text  
✅ Color contrast meets 4.5:1 for text  
✅ Site is fully keyboard navigable  
✅ Focus indicators are visible  
✅ Forms have proper labels  
✅ Heading structure is logical  
✅ Links have descriptive text  
✅ Videos have captions  
✅ Interactive elements are 24x24px minimum  

## Summary

Web accessibility in 2026 is:
- **Legal** – Required by EAA, ADA, and other regulations
- **Good for SEO** – Aligns with search engine best practices
- **Good for business** – Reaches more customers

Start with WCAG 2.2 Level AA as your target. Use automated tools for quick wins, then do manual testing.
