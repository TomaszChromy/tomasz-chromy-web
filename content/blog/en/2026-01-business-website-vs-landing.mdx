"I need a website" – I hear this often. But what exactly do you mean? A full business website with complete offerings? A landing page for a specific campaign? Or both?

A business website and landing page are two different tools with different goals. Not substitutes.

## 1. What Is a Business Website

A business website is your digital headquarters. A place where:

- You present your full offer and range of services
- You build credibility (about, portfolio, testimonials)
- You answer potential clients' questions
- You collect organic traffic from Google

**Goal:** Building trust and education. The user comes to get to know you.

**Typical structure:**
- Hero with value proposition
- Services / offer
- Portfolio / case studies
- About me / about company
- Client testimonials
- Blog / knowledge
- Contact

## 2. What Is a Landing Page

A landing page is a page with one goal. One. It might be:

- Webinar signup
- Ebook download
- Consultation booking
- Purchase of a specific product

**Goal:** Conversion. The user should do one specific thing.

**Typical structure:**
- Strong headline with promise
- Problem → solution
- Benefits (bullet points)
- Social proof (testimonials, numbers)
- CTA (form, button)
- FAQ

A landing page has no menu, blog, or "about company." Everything that distracts – goes away.

## 3. When You Need a Business Website

A business website is essential when:

- **You run a service business** and want clients to find you on Google
- **You're building a personal brand** or expertise
- **You have a complex offer** that needs explanation
- **You want to collect organic traffic** (SEO, content marketing)

Example: A freelancer offering web development. You need a site that shows: what you do, for whom, how you work, how much it costs.

## 4. When You Need a Landing Page

A landing page works when:

- **You're running a campaign** (Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- **You're promoting a specific product** or service
- **You're collecting leads** for a specific action (webinar, consultation)
- **You're testing an idea** before building a full product

Example: You're launching an online course. Landing page collects signups, business website continues working on SEO.

## 5. Does One Exclude the Other?

No. Quite the opposite – they work best together.

**Typical setup:**
1. Business website collects organic traffic and builds trust
2. Landing page converts traffic from paid campaigns
3. Blog on business website generates visits and links to landings

Visualization:

```
Google Ads → Landing page → Conversion
                  ↓
             "Who is this person?"
                  ↓
            Business website → Trust → Conversion
```

## 6. How Much Does Each Cost

Approximate ranges (2026):

| Type | Scope | Budget |
|------|-------|--------|
| Landing page | 1 page, form, tracking | €700-2,000 |
| Business website (simple) | 5-7 sections, responsive | €2,000-4,000 |
| Business website (expanded) | Blog, portfolio, multilingual | €4,000-8,000 |

**Tip:** If you have a limited budget, start with a good landing page for your campaign. Business website can come later.

## 7. Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using business website as landing page
You send ad traffic to homepage. User sees menu, blog, 10 options. Doesn't know what to click. Leaves.

### Mistake 2: Landing page without business website
You have a great landing, but client wants to learn more about you. Clicks logo – 404 or nothing.

### Mistake 3: Landing page that looks like business website
10 sections, complicated navigation, 5 different CTAs. This isn't a landing – it's chaos.

## 8. How I Approach Projects

When a client comes with "I need a website," I start with questions:

1. What's the main goal? (leads, trust, direct sales)
2. Where will traffic come from? (organic, paid, referrals)
3. What should the user do after visiting?

Based on this, we decide:
- Whether to start with business website, landing page, or both
- What structure makes sense
- Where to invest the budget

## 9. Summary

| | Business Website | Landing Page |
|---|---|---|
| Goal | Trust, education | Conversion |
| Structure | Full, expanded | Minimal, one path |
| Traffic | Organic, referrals | Paid, campaigns |
| Cost | €2,000-8,000 | €700-2,000 |

Don't ask "what's better?" Ask "what do I need more right now?"
