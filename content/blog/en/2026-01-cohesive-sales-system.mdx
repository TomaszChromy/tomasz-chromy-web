Most companies have digital chaos: website somewhere, CRM elsewhere, customer app on yet another platform. Data doesn't flow, processes don't connect, team wastes time on manual copying.

How to connect it into a cohesive system? Here's a practical guide.

## 1. The Problem: Tool Fragmentation

Typical scenario:
- Website on WordPress
- Leads go to email (or Excel)
- CRM (if exists) isn't connected to website
- Invoices in separate system
- Customer app is... nonexistent

Result:
- You lose leads (because no one manages the inbox)
- You don't know where customers come from
- Team spends hours on manual tasks
- Customer has to give same data 3 times

## 2. The Vision: Cohesive Digital Ecosystem

Instead of separate tools – **one flow**:

```
Website → Form → CRM → Automation → Customer Service → Customer App
```

Each element talks to others. Data flows automatically. Team focuses on work, not copying.

## 3. Ecosystem Layers

### Layer 1: Acquisition (Website + Landing)

Business website and landing pages are the **front door**:
- Generate traffic (SEO, ads)
- Convert visitors to leads (forms, chat)
- Collect data for CRM

### Layer 2: Sales and CRM

CRM is **command center**:
- All leads in one place
- Contact history with each customer
- Sales pipeline
- Automations (follow-ups, reminders)

### Layer 3: Delivery and Service

When lead becomes customer:
- Automatic project/order creation
- Invoicing (integration with accounting)
- Customer communication (statuses, documents)

### Layer 4: Customer Application

For regular customers – **self-service**:
- Customer portal (statuses, invoices, documents)
- Order/request submission
- Team communication

## 4. How to Build It Step by Step

### Step 1: Audit Current State

Before building anything:
- What tools do you have now?
- What works, what doesn't?
- Where are "holes" (data doesn't flow)?
- How much time do you waste on manual tasks?

### Step 2: Choose CRM as Center

CRM is the foundation. Options:

| CRM | For Whom | Cost |
|-----|----------|------|
| HubSpot (free) | Small businesses, start | €0 |
| Pipedrive | B2B sales | ~€40/month |
| Salesforce | Large companies | $$$$ |
| Custom (Supabase) | Specific needs | Depends |

For most small businesses: **HubSpot or Pipedrive**.

### Step 3: Integrate Website with CRM

Form on website → lead in CRM. Automatically.

Technical options:
- Webhooks (form sends data to CRM)
- Zapier / Make (no-code integration)
- Native integration (HubSpot has plugins for most platforms)

### Step 4: Sales Automations

When lead comes in:
1. Automatic confirmation email
2. Notification for salesperson
3. Task in CRM (call within 24h)
4. Follow-up sequence (if no response)

### Step 5: Integration with Delivery

When lead becomes customer:
1. Automatic project creation (in Asana, Notion, custom system)
2. Contract sending (DocuSign, PandaDoc)
3. Customer creation in accounting system

### Step 6: Customer Portal (Optional)

For companies with many customers or recurring services:
- Web application with login
- View of projects, invoices, documents
- Ability to submit orders

## 5. Example: Service Company Ecosystem

IT consulting firm, 5 people, 30 customers yearly.

**Before:**
- Website on WordPress (not connected to anything)
- Leads on email (got lost)
- Excel with customers
- Invoices in accounting software (manual)

**After:**
- Website on Next.js with form → HubSpot
- HubSpot as CRM (leads, pipeline, automations)
- HubSpot → Asana integration (projects)
- Accounting software integration → automatic invoices
- Simple customer portal (project statuses)

**Result:**
- 0 lost leads
- 5h/week less on administration
- Customer sees status without calling

## 6. How Much Does It Cost

Approximately:

| Element | One-time Cost | Monthly Cost |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Website with CRM integration | €2,500-5,000 | – |
| CRM (HubSpot/Pipedrive) | – | €0-120 |
| Automations (Zapier) | – | €0-50 |
| Customer portal (simple) | €4,000-8,000 | – |
| Customer portal (advanced) | €10,000-20,000 | – |

For small business: **start from €4,000-6,000** for website + CRM + basic automations.

## 7. When Does This Make Sense

✅ **Yes, if:**
- You have a repeatable sales process
- You're losing leads or time on administration
- You have > 10 customers yearly
- You want to scale without hiring

❌ **No, if:**
- You have 2-3 customers yearly (overkill)
- Process is different every time
- You don't have budget for implementation

## 8. Where to Start

1. **Audit** – where are holes in your process?
2. **CRM** – if you don't have one, start with free HubSpot
3. **Form integration** – website → CRM is a quick win
4. **Automations** – start with 1-2 simple ones (notifications, follow-up)
5. **Customer portal** – only when the rest works

## 9. Summary

Cohesive digital ecosystem is:
- Website as front door
- CRM as center
- Automations as glue
- Customer portal as self-service

You don't have to build everything at once. Start with foundations, expand iteratively.
