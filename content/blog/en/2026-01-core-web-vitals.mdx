Core Web Vitals sounds like a term from a developer presentation, but the effects are very business-oriented: loading time, page response to clicks, and element "jumping." If these parameters are bad, you lose customers before they even read your offer.

Below I explain what Core Web Vitals are, how they affect SEO and conversion, and what decisions you can make as a business owner without being a programmer.

## 1. What Are Core Web Vitals?

Google introduced three metrics under the common name Core Web Vitals that measure real user experience:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** – how quickly the main content is visible
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)** – how quickly the page responds to first interaction (e.g., click)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** – how much the layout "jumps" during loading

For business, this means a simple question: **Can the user see and use the site without frustration?**

Google openly states that good Core Web Vitals are one of the elements of properly evaluated "page quality" in search results.

## 2. How Bad Core Web Vitals Kill Conversion

Imagine you're driving traffic from ads to a landing page. You pay for every click. User:

1. Waits several seconds for loading
2. Suddenly sees a cookie banner that pops up above the button and everything shifts down
3. Clicks on the form, but page responds only after a moment
4. Something jumps again, and part of content loads after 2 seconds

This is a classic example of bad Core Web Vitals – and the reason why more and more campaigns end in disappointment.

From a data perspective:

- Bounce rate increases
- Time on page decreases
- Number of submitted forms / CTA clicks decreases

## 3. What You Can Do as a Business Owner (Without Touching Code)

You don't need to know how bundlers, lazy loading, or font preloading work. But you can:

### Ask the Right Questions to Your Developer:

- Will the site be optimized for Core Web Vitals?
- Do we check results in Google tools (Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, Search Console)?
- How do we monitor performance after launch?

### Define It as a Contractual Requirement:

E.g., "Site should achieve at least 'Good' status in Core Web Vitals for 75% of mobile users according to Search Console."

### Avoid "Heavy" Solutions:

- Excessive effects, animations, "floating" plugins like chat
- Large, unoptimized stock photos
- 10 different fonts from external servers

Well-chosen technology (e.g., Next.js + sensible approach to images and cache) plus common sense gives very good results with reasonable effort.

## 4. What Your Developer Should Do

From the technical side, the list is longer, but can be summarized:

- Use modern image formats (AVIF, WebP)
- Apply lazy loading for images and sections below the fold
- Minimize and split JS and CSS code
- Use CDN and HTTP cache
- Avoid blocking scripts (e.g., poorly implemented tracking)

In projects I create under the TomaszChromy.com brand, I treat this as standard, not an "extra option" – because it's part of product quality, not a gadget.

## 5. How to Monitor Core Web Vitals After Launch

Performance isn't a one-time thing. Even if everything shows green at launch, over time:

- New scripts are added (e.g., marketing, chat)
- Number of images grows
- Hosting changes

That's why it's worth:

- Regularly checking the Core Web Vitals report in Google Search Console
- Doing a short "performance review" once a quarter – especially if the site is heavily developed

Good practice in long-term collaboration is including this in the retainer: monthly/quarterly we check performance and fix what's needed.

## 6. Summary

Core Web Vitals aren't "Google's whim" or a topic only for programmers. It's a very practical indicator of whether your site is fast, responsive, and stable – meaning whether it doesn't discourage people before they even see the offer.

If you invest in traffic (SEO, ads, social media), treat performance as part of customer acquisition cost. Because every second of delay means leads you'll simply never see.
