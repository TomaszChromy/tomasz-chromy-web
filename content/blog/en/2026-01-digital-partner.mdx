"I'm looking for a developer" – OK, but what can you expect from this collaboration? How does communication look like? What's realistic and what's a red flag?

Here's an honest look at how cooperation with a digital partner looks – from both sides.

## 1. First Contact: What I Want to Know

When you reach out, I'm looking for a few key things:

- **What's the goal?** Not "I need a website" but "I want to increase lead generation by 30%"
- **What's the timeline?** "ASAP" tells me nothing. "Launch before Q2" is useful.
- **What's the budget range?** You don't need exact numbers, but a range helps match scope.
- **What have you tried before?** Understanding context prevents repeating mistakes.

## 2. The Discovery Call: 30-60 Minutes That Matter

This isn't a sales pitch. It's problem-solving together:

- I ask about your business, customers, and goals
- We discuss what's working and what isn't
- I share initial thoughts and potential approaches
- We determine if there's a good fit

No obligation. If it's not a match, I'll tell you honestly.

## 3. Proposal Phase: What You'll Get

After our call, I prepare a proposal that includes:

- **Scope definition** – exactly what will be built
- **Timeline** – realistic milestones, not promises I can't keep
- **Investment** – transparent pricing with breakdown
- **Process** – how we'll work together

You'll have questions. That's expected. We iterate until everything is clear.

## 4. During the Project: Communication Rhythm

Weekly updates at minimum:
- What was completed this week
- What's planned for next week
- Any blockers or decisions needed

For quick questions: Slack or email, typically same-day response.

For bigger discussions: scheduled video calls.

You'll have access to a staging environment to see progress in real-time.

## 5. Feedback and Iterations

I don't expect you to approve everything first time. Healthy projects include:

- Multiple feedback rounds
- Honest criticism (it helps!)
- Room for "I changed my mind" (within reason)

What I do expect:
- Timely feedback (within 48-72 hours)
- Clear, specific comments
- One point of contact for decisions

## 6. Red Flags from My Side

I'll be honest if I see:
- Scope creep without budget adjustment
- Decision paralysis (weeks of indecision kill projects)
- Too many stakeholders without clear authority
- Unrealistic expectations

I'd rather have a difficult conversation early than a failed project later.

## 7. Red Flags You Should Watch For

Warning signs when working with any developer:
- Promises that sound too good ("two weeks for everything!")
- No questions about your business goals
- Unwillingness to show previous work
- Poor communication during the sales process (it only gets worse)
- No clear process or milestones

## 8. After Launch: What Happens Next

Projects don't end at launch. Standard includes:
- 30 days of bug fixes
- Documentation
- Training on how to use the site

For ongoing relationship:
- Monthly maintenance packages available
- Priority support for existing clients
- Periodic performance reviews
- Growth recommendations

## 9. Pricing Models: What Works for What

**Fixed price:** Best for well-defined projects with clear scope. You know the cost upfront.

**Monthly retainer:** Best for ongoing work, continuous improvements, or when scope evolves.

**Time & materials:** Best for R&D, exploration, or when requirements are uncertain.

I typically start with fixed-price projects and move to retainers for long-term relationships.

## 10. What Makes a Great Client-Developer Relationship

From my experience, the best collaborations have:

- **Mutual respect** – you're the expert in your business, I'm the expert in digital
- **Clear communication** – no assumptions, everything documented
- **Trust** – you hired me for a reason, let me do my job
- **Shared goals** – we're both invested in the outcome

## Summary

Working with a digital partner should feel like having an extended team member, not a vendor you manage.

The right fit means:
- Clear communication both ways
- Honest feedback (both giving and receiving)
- Realistic expectations
- Long-term thinking
