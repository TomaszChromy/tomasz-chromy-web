"A blog? In 2026? Does that still work?" – Yes, it works. And better than ever for freelancers and small B2B businesses.

But not just any blog. Only one that's designed as part of the sales process.

## 1. Why Expert Blogs Still Make Sense

### SEO + E-E-A-T

Google increasingly values expert content. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is not a buzzword – it's a real ranking factor.

Blog with real knowledge = higher rankings = free traffic = leads.

### Long Tail

One good article works for years. You don't pay for clicks like with ads. Written once, read many times.

### Building Trust

A client who reads 3-4 of your articles knows you better than after a 10-minute call. They know how you think, your approach, whether it fits them.

### Supporting Sales

When a client asks "how much does a website cost?", instead of writing a long email – you send a link to an article. You save time, build expertise.

## 2. How Expert Blog Differs from "Regular Blog"

| Regular Blog | Expert Blog |
|--------------|-------------|
| "What's new with me" | Solves reader's specific problem |
| No structure | Clear topic plan |
| Published "when there's time" | Regular rhythm (e.g., 2-4x/month) |
| No CTA | Every article has a business goal |
| For "everyone" | For specific target audience |

Expert blog is content marketing with a plan, not a diary.

## 3. How to Plan an Expert Blog

### Step 1: Define Your Audience

Who are you writing for? Not "everyone." Specifically:
- Small business owners looking for a website?
- Startups building MVP?
- IT managers needing integrations?

### Step 2: Identify Questions

What questions do your potential clients ask before buying?
- "How much does a website cost?"
- "React or WordPress?"
- "What's the process?"
- "What to watch out for when choosing a developer?"

Each question = potential article.

### Step 3: Create Content Map

Group topics by funnel stages:

**Top of funnel (awareness):**
- Web development trends
- Do you need a website in 2026?

**Middle of funnel (consideration):**
- How much does a website/app cost
- React vs Next.js
- How to choose a developer

**Bottom of funnel (decision):**
- How working with me looks
- Case studies
- Pre-project FAQ

### Step 4: Set Rhythm

Better 2 good articles monthly for a year than 10 articles in a week and then silence.

My recommended rhythm for freelancers: **2-4 articles per month**.

## 4. Article Structure That Converts

### Headline
Clear, specific, promises value.
✓ "How Much Does a Website Cost in 2026? Complete Guide"
✗ "Some Thoughts on Pricing"

### Intro (2-3 sentences)
Hook + preview of what reader will get.

### Main Content
- Division into sections (H2, H3)
- Practical advice, not theory
- Examples, numbers, cases

### CTA at the End
Every article ends with a call to action:
- Book a consultation
- Download a checklist
- Contact me

## 5. SEO Minimum for Expert Blog

You don't need to be an SEO expert. Minimum:

- **Keyword in title and URL**
- **Meta description** (150-160 characters)
- **H2, H3 headings** (structure)
- **Internal links** (to other articles)
- **Alt for images**

Plus: articles of 1000-2000 words rank better than 300-word notes.

## 6. Distribution – Blog Is Not "Publish and Pray"

The article itself is 50% of the work. The other 50% is distribution:

- **LinkedIn** – post with main thesis + link
- **Newsletter** – notify subscribers
- **Group responses** – "I wrote about this, link in comments"
- **Internal linking** – from other articles

## 7. How Much Does Running a Blog Cost

Options:

**You write yourself:**
- Time: 3-6h per article
- Cost: €0 (only your time)

**Copywriter + your editing:**
- Cost: €100-200 per article
- Time: 1-2h for editing

**Full service (copywriter + SEO + graphics):**
- Cost: €200-500 per article

For freelancers: start yourself, see what works, then delegate.

## 8. How to Measure Results

After 3-6 months of regular publishing, you should see:

- **Organic traffic** (Google Search Console)
- **Time on page** (Google Analytics)
- **Leads from blog** (forms, emails with article links)

If nothing after 6 months – either topics are wrong or SEO is weak.

## 9. Summary

Expert blog is:
- Long-term investment, not quick hack
- Part of sales process, not hobby
- Tool for building trust before first contact

Start with 10 articles answering your clients' questions. The rest will follow.

And if you need a website with a blog that actually generates leads – you know where to find me.
