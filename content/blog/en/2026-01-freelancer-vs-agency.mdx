You've decided you need a new website or web application. Now the question: who should build it? You have three main options: freelancer, agency, or in-house team. Each has its place.

## Option 1: Freelancer

### Pros

**Lower cost.** No office overhead, no account managers, no project managers. You pay for the work, not the structure.

**Direct communication.** You talk to the person who writes the code. No game of telephone.

**Flexibility.** Freelancers often work outside 9-5. Need a quick fix on Saturday? Usually possible.

**Specialization.** Good freelancers focus on what they do best. You get an expert, not a generalist.

### Cons

**Limited capacity.** One person can only do so much. Large projects may take longer.

**Single point of failure.** If the freelancer gets sick or disappears, you have a problem.

**No team.** Complex projects requiring design, development, and marketing need multiple freelancers.

### Best for

- Small to medium projects (landing pages, business websites, simple apps)
- Budgets under €20,000
- When you want direct communication
- When you have clear requirements

## Option 2: Agency

### Pros

**Full team.** Designers, developers, project managers, copywriters – all under one roof.

**Scalability.** Can handle large, complex projects with multiple workstreams.

**Processes.** Established workflows, documentation, quality assurance.

**Continuity.** If one person leaves, the project continues.

### Cons

**Higher cost.** You're paying for the structure, office, and overhead. Expect 2-5x freelancer rates.

**Communication layers.** You talk to an account manager who talks to a project manager who talks to the developer.

**Less flexibility.** Agencies have processes. Changing scope mid-project is harder.

**Variable quality.** The senior who pitched may not be the junior who builds.

### Best for

- Large, complex projects (enterprise websites, complex applications)
- Budgets above €50,000
- When you need multiple disciplines
- When you want someone else to manage the project

## Option 3: In-House Team

### Pros

**Full control.** Your team, your priorities, your timeline.

**Deep knowledge.** They understand your business inside out.

**Availability.** Always there when you need them.

**Long-term investment.** Skills stay in the company.

### Cons

**Highest cost.** Salaries, benefits, equipment, training. A developer costs €50-100k/year fully loaded.

**Hiring challenge.** Finding good developers is hard. Keeping them is harder.

**Limited perspective.** Internal teams can develop tunnel vision.

**Overhead.** You need work for them even when there's no project.

### Best for

- Companies with continuous development needs
- When technology is core to your business
- When you have budget for 2+ full-time developers
- Long-term product development

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Typical Project Cost | Monthly Retainer |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Freelancer | €2,000-20,000 | €500-2,000 |
| Agency | €10,000-100,000+ | €2,000-10,000 |
| In-House | N/A | €5,000-15,000/person |

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself:

1. **What's your budget?** Under €20k → freelancer. Over €50k → consider agency.

2. **How complex is the project?** Simple website → freelancer. Enterprise platform → agency or in-house.

3. **How important is speed?** Need it fast → freelancer (no onboarding). Can wait → agency.

4. **Do you have ongoing needs?** One-off project → freelancer/agency. Continuous development → in-house.

5. **How technical are you?** Can manage a developer → freelancer. Need hand-holding → agency.

## The Hybrid Approach

Many companies use a combination:

- **In-house** for core product development
- **Freelancers** for specialized skills or overflow
- **Agency** for large campaigns or redesigns

This gives you flexibility without the overhead of a large team.

## My Honest Take

For most small to medium businesses, a good freelancer is the best value. You get expertise, direct communication, and reasonable rates.

Agencies make sense for large projects where you need a full team and project management. But be prepared to pay for it.

In-house only makes sense if you have continuous development needs and can afford to hire and retain good people.

## Summary

| | Freelancer | Agency | In-House |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost | € | €€€ | €€€€ |
| Communication | Direct | Layered | Direct |
| Flexibility | High | Medium | High |
| Capacity | Limited | High | Depends |
| Best for | Small-medium projects | Large projects | Continuous development |
