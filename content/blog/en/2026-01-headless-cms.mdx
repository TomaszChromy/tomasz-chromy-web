"You need a headless CMS" – you might hear this from developers. But what does it mean, and is it right for your project? Let's cut through the hype.

## What Is a Headless CMS?

Traditional CMS (like WordPress) combines content management with the frontend. You edit content, and the same system displays it.

Headless CMS separates these:
- **Backend** – Where you manage content (the "body")
- **Frontend** – Where content is displayed (the "head")

They communicate via API. The frontend can be anything: website, mobile app, smart TV, digital signage.

## Popular Headless CMS Options

| CMS | Type | Best For | Pricing |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| Sanity | Hosted | Flexibility, real-time | Free tier, then usage-based |
| Contentful | Hosted | Enterprise, teams | Free tier, then €€€ |
| Strapi | Self-hosted | Control, open source | Free (hosting costs) |
| Payload | Self-hosted | Developers, TypeScript | Free (hosting costs) |
| Hygraph | Hosted | GraphQL, content federation | Free tier, then €€ |

## When Headless Makes Sense

### 1. Multi-Channel Content

You need the same content on:
- Website
- Mobile app
- Digital signage
- Email newsletters

With headless, you write once, publish everywhere.

### 2. Custom Frontend Requirements

You want:
- React/Next.js for performance
- Complete design freedom
- Complex interactions
- Integration with other systems

Headless gives you full control over the frontend.

### 3. Developer-First Teams

Your team:
- Has strong frontend developers
- Wants to use modern frameworks
- Values version control for content models
- Needs CI/CD integration

### 4. High-Traffic Sites

You need:
- Static site generation for speed
- CDN distribution
- Separation of concerns
- Scalability

### 5. Complex Content Models

Your content has:
- Many relationships between types
- Reusable components
- Localization requirements
- Structured data needs

## When Headless Is Overkill

### 1. Simple Blogs or Brochure Sites

If you just need:
- 5-10 pages
- Occasional updates
- No special integrations

WordPress or even Squarespace is simpler and cheaper.

### 2. Non-Technical Content Editors

If your content team:
- Isn't tech-savvy
- Needs WYSIWYG editing
- Wants to see exactly how content will look
- Doesn't want to learn new tools

Traditional CMS with visual editing is friendlier.

### 3. Tight Budgets

Headless requires:
- Frontend development (custom)
- Hosting for frontend
- Potentially hosting for CMS
- More initial development time

For small budgets, traditional CMS is more cost-effective.

### 4. Quick Turnaround

You need the site live in:
- 1-2 weeks
- With minimal development

Template-based solutions are faster.

## The Middle Ground: Hybrid Solutions

Some options bridge the gap:

**WordPress + Headless:** Use WordPress as a headless CMS with a React frontend. Familiar editing, modern frontend.

**Next.js + MDX:** For developer blogs, content lives in the codebase as Markdown files. No CMS needed.

**Page Builders with APIs:** Some traditional CMS offer API access alongside visual editing.

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Initial Dev | Monthly Hosting | Content Editing |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| WordPress | €2-5k | €10-50 | Easy |
| Headless (hosted) | €5-15k | €0-200 | Medium |
| Headless (self-hosted) | €5-15k | €20-100 | Medium |
| Static + MDX | €3-8k | €0-20 | Requires dev |

## Questions to Ask

Before choosing headless, ask:

1. **Who will edit content?** Technical or non-technical?
2. **How often will content change?** Daily or monthly?
3. **Do you need multi-channel?** Website only or more?
4. **What's your budget?** Initial and ongoing?
5. **What's your timeline?** Weeks or months?

## My Recommendation

**Choose headless if:**
- You have a development team or budget for one
- You need multi-channel content delivery
- Performance and scalability are priorities
- You want long-term flexibility

**Choose traditional CMS if:**
- Content editors are non-technical
- Budget is limited
- You need to launch quickly
- It's a simple site with occasional updates

## Summary

Headless CMS is powerful but not always necessary. It's the right choice for complex, multi-channel, performance-critical projects with technical teams.

For simpler needs, traditional CMS or hybrid solutions often make more sense.
