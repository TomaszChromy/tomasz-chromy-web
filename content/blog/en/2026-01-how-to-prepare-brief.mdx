"Send a brief" – you hear from a developer and don't know where to start. Relax. A brief is not a 50-page document. It's organized information that helps both sides.

A good brief saves time, money, and nerves. A bad brief (or lack thereof) is a straight path to misunderstandings and exceeded budgets.

## 1. Why Brief at All

A brief is:
- **Your way of communicating** – you show what you need
- **Reference point** – we return to it when in doubt
- **Basis for quote** – without a brief, quoting is fortune-telling

You don't need a ready brief before the first conversation. But the more you think through beforehand, the better quote you'll get.

## 2. What a Good Brief Should Contain

### a) About Company / Project

- Who are you? (industry, company size, business model)
- What do you sell/offer?
- Who are your customers?

**Example:**
"We run an IT consulting firm. Our clients are medium companies (50-200 employees) from the manufacturing sector. They're looking for security audits and ERP implementations."

### b) Project Goal

- What do you want to achieve? (more leads, better conversion, new sales channel)
- What problem are you solving?
- How will you measure success?

**Example:**
"We want to generate 10 quote requests monthly from organic traffic. Currently we have 2-3."

### c) Project Scope

- What should be created? (business website, landing, application, store)
- What features are essential?
- What's "nice to have" vs "must have"?

**Example:**
"Business website: hero, services, portfolio (5 case studies), blog, contact. Nice to have: pricing calculator."

### d) Design and Style

- Do you have a brand book / visual identity?
- What websites do you like? (competition, inspiration)
- What do you want to avoid?

**Example:**
"We have logo and colors (attached). We like the style: clean, lots of white, no corporate clichés. We DON'T want stock photos of people in suits."

### e) Content

- Who provides texts?
- Do you have photos / materials?
- Is copywriting help needed?

**Example:**
"We'll write texts ourselves based on your template. We have photos – our own team and office photos."

### f) Constraints

- What's the budget? (at least a range)
- When must the project be ready?
- Are there technical constraints? (hosting, CMS, integrations)

**Example:**
"Budget: €4,000-5,000. Deadline: end of Q1 2026. Must work on our OVH hosting."

## 3. Brief Template (Copy-Paste Ready)

- Graphic materials: [ ] Have them [ ] Need them

## 6. Constraints

## 7. Other Notes
```

## 4. What You DON'T Need to Know

You don't need to know:
- What technology (React, WordPress, whatever)
- How many subpages
- Exactly how each feature should work

We'll figure that out together. Brief is a starting point, not technical specification.

## 5. Red Flags in Briefs (Developer's Perspective)

### "Make it like Amazon, budget: €2k"
Unrealistic scope vs budget. Better to have smaller scope but realistic.

### "I don't know what I want, but I'll know when I see it"
No vision = hundreds of iterations = frustration on both sides.

### "Deadline: 2 weeks"
For a business website you need minimum 4-6 weeks. For an application – more.

### "Budget? Quote first"
Without a range, developer shoots in the dark. Giving a budget range doesn't mean you'll spend it – but allows matching scope.

## 6. What Happens After Sending Brief

1. Developer reads and asks clarifying questions
2. Call (30-60 min) – clarification
3. Quote / proposal
4. Scope negotiation (if budget doesn't fit)
5. Contract and start

The better the brief, the shorter the path to start.

## 7. Summary

A good brief is:
- Clear goal and target audience
- Defined scope (must have vs nice to have)
- Realistic constraints (budget, deadline)
- Inspirations and style preferences

Doesn't need to be long. Needs to be thought through.
