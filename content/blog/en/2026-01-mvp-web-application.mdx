MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is one of the most used – and most misunderstood – concepts in the startup and digital product world. Many entrepreneurs think MVP means "cheap, unfinished version." Nothing could be further from the truth.

MVP is a strategic decision: what to build first to validate an idea without spending a fortune.

## 1. What MVP Really Is

MVP is the **smallest product that delivers value** and allows you to collect feedback from real users.

Key words:
- **Smallest** – we don't build everything, only what's essential
- **Value** – it must solve a real problem, not be a "demo"
- **Feedback** – the goal is learning, not perfection

Example: If you're building a project management app, MVP is not "Asana in 3 months." It might be a simple Kanban board for one team that does one thing well.

## 2. Why Companies Burn Budget on First Versions

### "Everything at Once" Syndrome

"We need an admin panel, integration with 5 systems, mobile app, AI dashboard..." – sound familiar?

Problem: more features = longer development time, more bugs, more testing. And more money.

### Lack of Prioritization

Without a clear hierarchy of "what's critical vs nice-to-have," everything becomes equally important. Developer doesn't know where to start, client doesn't know what to test.

### Perfectionism

"It must be perfect before launch" – this is a trap. Better to launch something simple and improve based on feedback than spend months polishing a product nobody uses.

## 3. How to Properly Define MVP

### Step 1: Define the Problem

Before thinking about features, answer: **What problem are you solving and for whom?**

Not "I want an app for X," but "my customers waste 5 hours weekly on Y because they don't have a tool for Z."

### Step 2: Identify Core Feature

What **one feature** is absolutely essential for the product to make sense? That's your core feature.

Everything else – integrations, dashboards, automations – are additions for later.

### Step 3: Create Priority Map

Divide features into:
- **Must have** – product doesn't work without it
- **Should have** – important but not critical for launch
- **Nice to have** – cool but can wait

MVP = only "Must have."

### Step 4: Define Success Metrics

How will you know MVP works? What do you measure?
- Number of signups?
- Time spent in app?
- User return rate?

Without metrics, you don't know if you're heading in the right direction.

## 4. How Much Does a Web Application MVP Cost

Depends on complexity, but roughly:

| MVP Type | Scope | Approximate Budget |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Landing + waitlist | Page, form, mailing | €1,000-2,500 |
| Simple CRUD app | Login, basic operations, simple UI | €5,000-10,000 |
| App with integrations | Payments, external APIs, dashboard | €10,000-20,000 |
| Complex SaaS product | Multi-tenant, roles, advanced logic | €20,000-40,000+ |

**Important:** These are ranges for MVP, not full product. Full version can cost 2-5x more.

## 5. Technology for MVP

For most web application MVPs, I recommend:

- **Frontend:** Next.js or React
- **Backend:** Node.js or Supabase (if you want speed)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Vercel, Railway, or own VPS

Key: choose technology the developer knows well. MVP is not the time for experiments.

## 6. MVP Build Process

### Phase 1: Discovery (1-2 weeks)
- Problem and user analysis
- Core feature definition
- Feature map and priorities

### Phase 2: Design (1-2 weeks)
- Wireframes of key screens
- Basic design system
- Clickable prototype (optional)

### Phase 3: Development (4-8 weeks)
- Iterative feature building
- Weekly demos and feedback
- Continuous testing

### Phase 4: Launch (1 week)
- Production deployment
- Monitoring and fixes
- First real users

## 7. What Comes After MVP

MVP is the beginning, not the end. After launch:

1. **Collect feedback** – talk to users, analyze data
2. **Iterate** – fix what doesn't work, develop what does
3. **Scale carefully** – don't add features "just in case"

The best products grow organically, not through "big releases."

## 8. Summary

MVP is not a "cheap version of product." It's a strategic approach:

- Define problem and core feature
- Build smallest version that delivers value
- Launch, collect feedback, iterate

If you have a product idea and want to validate it without burning budget – let's talk. I help go from idea to working MVP.
