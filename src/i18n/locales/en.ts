        content: `
          <p class="text-xl text-cool-200 mb-8">One of the most common questions I receive from potential clients is: "How much will my website cost?" The honest answer is: it depends. But let me break down exactly what factors influence the price and give you realistic expectations.</p>

          <h2>Understanding website pricing</h2>
          <p>Website costs vary dramatically based on complexity, features, and who builds it. A simple landing page might cost €500-2,000, while a complex e-commerce platform could run €10,000-50,000 or more. Let's look at what drives these differences.</p>

          <h2>Key factors that affect price</h2>

          <h3>1. Type of website</h3>
          <p><strong>Landing page (€500-2,000):</strong> A single-page website focused on one goal - usually lead generation or product promotion. Perfect for startups validating an idea.</p>
          <p><strong>Business website (€2,000-8,000):</strong> 5-15 pages including home, about, services, portfolio, and contact. Most small businesses fall into this category.</p>
          <p><strong>E-commerce (€5,000-30,000):</strong> Online stores with product management, payment processing, shipping integration. Price scales with number of products and features.</p>
          <p><strong>Web application (€10,000+):</strong> Custom functionality like user dashboards, booking systems, or SaaS platforms. These require significant development time.</p>

          <h3>2. Design complexity</h3>
          <p>A template-based design costs less than custom design. Custom illustrations, animations, and unique layouts increase the price but also make your site stand out.</p>

          <h3>3. Content requirements</h3>
          <p>Do you have ready content, or do you need copywriting? Professional photography? These add to the budget but significantly impact conversion rates.</p>

          <h3>4. Technical requirements</h3>
          <p>Integrations with CRM, email marketing, payment gateways, or custom APIs all add complexity and cost.</p>

          <h2>What you're really paying for</h2>
          <p>When you hire a professional developer, you're not just paying for code. You're paying for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strategy</strong> - understanding your business goals and translating them into effective design</li>
            <li><strong>Experience</strong> - avoiding common mistakes that could cost you customers</li>
            <li><strong>Quality</strong> - clean code that's fast, secure, and maintainable</li>
            <li><strong>Support</strong> - someone to call when things break or need updating</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to budget for your website</h2>
          <p>Here's my advice: think about your website as an investment, not an expense. A well-designed website that converts visitors into customers pays for itself many times over.</p>
          <p>Start with your goals. What do you need the website to achieve? Then prioritize features based on what will have the biggest impact on those goals.</p>

          <h2>Red flags to watch for</h2>
          <p>Be cautious of quotes that seem too good to be true. Extremely low prices often mean:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Template-only solutions with no customization</li>
            <li>Offshore teams with communication challenges</li>
            <li>Hidden costs that appear later</li>
            <li>Poor quality code that causes problems down the road</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>A professional business website typically costs between €2,000-8,000. E-commerce and web applications start at €5,000 and can go much higher depending on requirements.</p>
          <p>The best approach? Have an honest conversation with a developer about your goals and budget. A good developer will help you prioritize features and find the right solution for your needs.</p>

          <p class="text-xl text-cool-200 mb-8">If you're planning a new web project, you've probably heard about React and Next.js. Both are excellent tools, but they serve different purposes. Let me explain when to use each one.</p>

          <h2>What is React?</h2>
          <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Created by Facebook (now Meta), it's the most popular front-end tool in the world. React lets you build interactive, dynamic web applications using reusable components.</p>
          <p>A "pure" React application is a Single Page Application (SPA) - the entire app loads once, and navigation happens without page refreshes.</p>

          <h2>What is Next.js?</h2>
          <p>Next.js is a framework built on top of React. It adds features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based routing, and API routes. Think of it as React with superpowers.</p>

          <h2>Key differences</h2>

          <h3>Rendering</h3>
          <p><strong>React (SPA):</strong> Everything renders in the browser. The server sends a minimal HTML file, and JavaScript builds the page on the client side.</p>
          <p><strong>Next.js:</strong> Offers multiple rendering options - server-side rendering, static generation, or client-side rendering. You can even mix them within the same application.</p>

          <h3>SEO</h3>
          <p><strong>React:</strong> Challenging for SEO because search engines may not execute JavaScript properly. Requires additional configuration for good SEO.</p>
          <p><strong>Next.js:</strong> Excellent SEO out of the box. Server-rendered pages are fully visible to search engines.</p>

          <h3>Performance</h3>
          <p><strong>React:</strong> Initial load can be slow as the browser downloads and executes all JavaScript before showing content.</p>
          <p><strong>Next.js:</strong> Faster initial load with server rendering. Built-in image optimization, code splitting, and prefetching.</p>

          <h3>Routing</h3>
          <p><strong>React:</strong> Requires a third-party library like React Router.</p>
          <p><strong>Next.js:</strong> File-based routing built in. Create a file in the pages folder, and it automatically becomes a route.</p>

          <h2>When to choose React (SPA)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Building a dashboard or admin panel</li>
            <li>Internal tools that don't need SEO</li>
            <li>Highly interactive applications like design tools</li>
            <li>When you need complete control over the architecture</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When to choose Next.js</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Marketing websites that need good SEO</li>
            <li>E-commerce stores</li>
            <li>Blogs and content-heavy sites</li>
            <li>Applications that need fast initial load times</li>
            <li>When you want to ship faster with less configuration</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>My recommendation</h2>
          <p>For most business websites, I recommend Next.js. The SEO benefits, performance optimizations, and developer experience are hard to beat. The framework handles many complex decisions for you, letting you focus on building features.</p>
          <p>Use pure React when you're building internal tools, dashboards, or applications where SEO doesn't matter and you need maximum flexibility.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Both React and Next.js are excellent choices. Next.js is better for public-facing websites that need SEO and performance. React SPAs work great for dashboards and internal applications.</p>
          <p>The good news? Skills transfer between them. If you know React, learning Next.js is straightforward - it's still React at its core.</p>

          <p class="text-xl text-cool-200 mb-8">Transparency is key to successful projects. Here's exactly what happens when we work together - from the first conversation to launch day and beyond.</p>

          <h2>Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1)</h2>
          <p>Every project starts with understanding. During our initial call, I'll ask about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your business goals - what should this website achieve?</li>
            <li>Your target audience - who are you trying to reach?</li>
            <li>Your competitors - what are they doing well or poorly?</li>
            <li>Your timeline and budget - let's be realistic from the start</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After this call, I create a detailed proposal including scope, timeline, and investment. No surprises later.</p>

          <h2>Phase 2: Design (Weeks 2-3)</h2>
          <p>Once we agree on the scope, I start with wireframes - simple layouts that show structure without visual design. This helps us nail the user flow before investing in detailed design.</p>
          <p>After wireframe approval, I create high-fidelity mockups in Figma. You'll see exactly how your site will look on desktop and mobile. We iterate until you're completely happy.</p>

          <h2>Phase 3: Development (Weeks 3-5)</h2>
          <p>This is where designs become reality. I build with modern technologies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>React / Next.js</strong> for the front-end</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> for type-safe, maintainable code</li>
            <li><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for responsive, custom styling</li>
            <li><strong>Headless CMS</strong> for easy content management</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Throughout development, you'll have access to a staging site where you can see progress and provide feedback.</p>

          <h2>Phase 4: Review & Testing (Week 5-6)</h2>
          <p>Before launch, we thoroughly test:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)</li>
            <li>Mobile responsiveness on real devices</li>
            <li>Page speed and Core Web Vitals</li>
            <li>Forms and integrations</li>
            <li>SEO basics (meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You'll review the final site and request any last adjustments.</p>

          <h2>Phase 5: Launch</h2>
          <p>Launch day is exciting! I handle all technical aspects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Domain configuration and SSL setup</li>
            <li>Deployment to production</li>
            <li>Analytics and tracking setup</li>
            <li>Performance monitoring</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>After launch: Ongoing support</h2>
          <p>The relationship doesn't end at launch. All projects include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>30 days of free bug fixes and minor adjustments</li>
            <li>Documentation for content management</li>
            <li>Training session on how to use your new site</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I also offer monthly maintenance packages for updates, security patches, and ongoing improvements.</p>

          <h2>Communication throughout</h2>
          <p>You'll never wonder what's happening with your project. I provide:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weekly progress updates via email</li>
            <li>Slack/Teams access for quick questions</li>
            <li>Video calls for major decisions</li>
            <li>Clear timeline with milestones</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Ready to start?</h2>
          <p>The first step is a free 15-minute consultation. We'll discuss your project, and I'll give you honest feedback on timeline and budget expectations.</p>

          <p class="text-xl text-cool-200 mb-8">Website speed isn't just a technical metric - it directly affects your business. Every second of delay costs you visitors, conversions, and revenue. Here's why speed matters and how to achieve it.</p>

          <h2>The business case for speed</h2>
          <p>The data is clear:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load</li>
            <li>A 1-second delay reduces conversions by 7%</li>
            <li>Google uses page speed as a ranking factor</li>
            <li>Fast sites have lower bounce rates and higher engagement</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If your website generates €100,000/year in revenue, a 1-second speed improvement could mean €7,000 more annually.</p>

          <h2>What makes websites slow?</h2>

          <h3>1. Unoptimized images</h3>
          <p>Images are often the biggest culprits. A single unoptimized photo can be 5MB - that's larger than some entire websites should be.</p>

          <h3>2. Too much JavaScript</h3>
          <p>JavaScript is powerful but expensive. Every kilobyte needs to be downloaded, parsed, and executed. Bloated frameworks and unnecessary libraries add up quickly.</p>

          <h3>3. Slow server response</h3>
          <p>If your server takes 2 seconds to respond, your page can't possibly load in under 2 seconds. Hosting quality matters.</p>

          <h3>4. Render-blocking resources</h3>
          <p>CSS and JavaScript that block rendering prevent the page from showing content until they're fully loaded.</p>

          <h2>How to make your website fast</h2>

          <h3>Image optimization</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use modern formats like WebP (30-50% smaller than JPEG)</li>
            <li>Implement responsive images with srcset</li>
            <li>Lazy load images below the fold</li>
            <li>Compress images without visible quality loss</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Minimize JavaScript</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Only load what you need</li>
            <li>Code split - load features when they're needed</li>
            <li>Use modern, lightweight frameworks</li>
            <li>Remove unused code (tree shaking)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Optimize delivery</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a CDN to serve assets from locations near your users</li>
            <li>Enable compression (gzip or Brotli)</li>
            <li>Set proper caching headers</li>
            <li>Consider static site generation for content that doesn't change often</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Improve server response</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose quality hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or quality VPS)</li>
            <li>Use server-side caching</li>
            <li>Optimize database queries</li>
            <li>Consider edge computing for global audiences</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Measuring performance</h2>
          <p>Use these tools to measure and monitor:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong> - Lab and field data with specific recommendations</li>
            <li><strong>Lighthouse</strong> - Comprehensive audits built into Chrome DevTools</li>
            <li><strong>WebPageTest</strong> - Detailed waterfall analysis from different locations</li>
            <li><strong>Core Web Vitals</strong> - Google's key metrics for user experience</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Core Web Vitals explained</h2>
          <p>Google's Core Web Vitals are the metrics that matter most:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</strong> - Should be under 2.5 seconds. Measures when the main content becomes visible.</li>
            <li><strong>FID (First Input Delay)</strong> - Should be under 100ms. Measures how quickly the page responds to interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</strong> - Should be under 0.1. Measures visual stability - does content jump around?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>My approach to performance</h2>
          <p>Every website I build is optimized for speed from the start:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Modern frameworks with automatic code splitting</li>
            <li>Automatic image optimization with Next.js Image component</li>
            <li>Static generation where possible</li>
            <li>Minimal JavaScript bundles</li>
            <li>Performance testing before every launch</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Website speed is not optional in 2025. It affects user experience, SEO, and your bottom line. The good news? With modern tools and best practices, building fast websites is easier than ever.</p>
          <p>If your current website is slow, there's almost always room for improvement. Sometimes small optimizations yield dramatic results.</p>

        excerpt: "In 2026, a website is not just a business card. It's a sales tool that should generate leads. Learn why your site isn't delivering results.",
        content: `
          <p class="text-xl text-cool-200 mb-8">In 2026, a website is no longer just a "business card." It's a sales tool that should generate leads, support the sales process, and take the load off your team. The problem is that most websites are still designed as if time stopped in 2015.</p>

          <p>In this article, I'll show you, from a digital product developer's perspective, why your website isn't delivering results and what you can do to change that.</p>

          <h2>1. No Clear Message: "What, For Whom, With What Result"</h2>
          <p>A user lands on your website and within 3-5 seconds must understand three things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you do?</li>
            <li>Who is it for?</li>
            <li>What result do you deliver?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If they see generic slogans in the hero section ("Welcome to our website," "Comprehensive IT solutions") or a list of technologies, they can't connect it to their problem. The result? They leave.</p>

          <h3>How to fix it:</h3>
          <p>Build your headline using this formula: "I help [specific clients] achieve [specific result] using [specific type of solutions]."</p>
          <p>In the subtitle, clarify what the result looks like in practice (more leads, faster service, less chaos).</p>

          <h2>2. Lack of Trust: Zero Proof, Only Promises</h2>
          <p>People no longer believe slogans. They believe in proof:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Case studies with concrete results</li>
            <li>Client testimonials with name, position, and industry</li>
            <li>Logos of companies you've worked with</li>
            <li>Numbers: "25+ projects," "3+ years of experience," "100% satisfaction"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In 2025-2026, expert content and E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) are among the most important SEO and trust factors.</p>

          <h2>3. Weak CTAs and Difficult Contact</h2>
          <p>A common mistake: contact form hidden at the bottom of the page with no clear information about "what happens after you send it."</p>
          <p>A good website in 2026 has:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visible CTA buttons in multiple places ("Schedule a consultation," "Request a quote," "Call")</li>
            <li>Short, simple form (name, email, project description, optionally budget range)</li>
            <li>Information about when to expect a response ("I reply within 1-2 business days")</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. The Website Is Simply... Slow</h2>
          <p>Google has been clearly communicating for years that Core Web Vitals – the real user experience related to loading, interactivity, and visual stability – are important for both UX and search visibility.</p>
          <p>If your site takes 4-5 seconds to load and content "jumps" during loading, users abandon it immediately. Even the most polished text won't help.</p>

          <h3>What you can do with your developer:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Optimize graphics (next-gen formats, compression)</li>
            <li>Enable lazy loading for images and sections off-screen</li>
            <li>Simplify CSS and JS (remove unused libraries)</li>
            <li>Use cache and CDN</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. No WCAG 2.2 Compliance and Mobile Adaptation</h2>
          <p>Since 2023, WCAG 2.2 has been the official standard – the new version of accessibility guidelines that adds 9 additional criteria regarding clickable element size, keyboard navigation, and simple authentication.</p>
          <p>In practice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Too-small buttons on mobile</li>
            <li>Poor text contrast</li>
            <li>Missing focus states for active elements</li>
            <li>Forms unfriendly to users with cognitive difficulties</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is no longer just an "aesthetic issue" but a legal and business risk (rejected users).</p>

          <h2>6. No Consistent Story and Process</h2>
          <p>When a user scrolls through the page, they should feel like someone is guiding them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who you are and what you do (hero)</li>
            <li>Who it's for (target group adaptation)</li>
            <li>What problems you solve (services, cases)</li>
            <li>How you work (process)</li>
            <li>How much it costs (at least price ranges)</li>
            <li>What to do next (contact / consultation)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If sections are random and the narrative is interrupted, the user gets lost. A good website is actually a well-structured sales conversation, just in digital form.</p>

          <h2>7. Summary: Website as a Tool, Not a Catalog</h2>
          <p>If you want your website to start actually working for your business:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear message – specifically: what, for whom, with what effect</li>
            <li>Add proof – projects, testimonials, numbers, your own products</li>
            <li>Make contact easy – strong CTAs, simple form, clear expectations</li>
            <li>Take care of performance – Core Web Vitals, lightweight resources</li>
            <li>Unify UX and accessibility – WCAG 2.2 instead of "it'll be fine somehow"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is the approach I follow in projects created under the TomaszChromy.com brand – treating the website as part of the sales process, not a digital business card that everyone forgets a week after launch.</p>

If these parameters are poor, you lose customers before they even read your offer.</p>

          <p>Below I explain what Core Web Vitals are, how they affect SEO and conversion, and what decisions you can make as a business owner without being a programmer.</p>

          <h2>1. What Are Core Web Vitals?</h2>
          <p>Google introduced three metrics under the common name Core Web Vitals that measure real user experience:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</strong> – how quickly the main content becomes visible</li>
            <li><strong>INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</strong> – how quickly the page responds to first interaction (e.g., click)</li>
            <li><strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</strong> – how much the layout "jumps" during loading</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For business, this means a simple question: Can the user see and use the page without getting frustrated?</p>
          <p>Google openly states that good Core Web Vitals are one element of properly assessed "page quality" in search results.</p>

          <h2>2. How Poor Core Web Vitals Kill Conversion</h2>
          <p>Imagine you're driving traffic from ads to a landing page. You pay for every click. The user:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Waits several seconds for loading</li>
            <li>Sees a cookie banner suddenly appear above the button and everything shifts down</li>
            <li>Clicks on the form, but the page responds after a moment</li>
            <li>Something jumps again, and part of the content loads after 2 seconds</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is a classic example of poor Core Web Vitals – and the reason why more and more campaigns end in disappointment.</p>
          <p>From a data perspective:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bounce rate increases</li>
            <li>Time on page decreases</li>
            <li>Number of submitted forms / CTA clicks drops</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. What You Can Do as a Business Owner (Without Getting Into Code)</h2>
          <p>You don't need to know how a bundler, lazy loading, or font preloading works. But you can:</p>

          <h3>Ask the right questions to your contractor:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Will the website be optimized for Core Web Vitals?</li>
            <li>Will we check results in Google tools (Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, Search Console)?</li>
            <li>How will we monitor performance after launch?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Define it as a contract requirement:</h3>
          <p>E.g., "The website should achieve at least 'Good' status in Core Web Vitals for 75% of mobile users according to Search Console."</p>

          <h3>Give up "heavy" solutions:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Excessive effects, animations, "floating" plugins like chat</li>
            <li>Large, unoptimized stock photos</li>
            <li>10 different fonts from external servers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Well-chosen technology (e.g., Next.js + sensible approach to images and cache) plus common sense gives very good results with reasonable effort.</p>

          <h2>4. What Your Developer Should Do</h2>
          <p>From the technical side, the list is longer, but can be summarized:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use modern image formats (AVIF, WebP)</li>
            <li>Apply lazy loading for images and sections off the first screen</li>
            <li>Minimize and split JS and CSS code</li>
            <li>Use CDN and HTTP cache</li>
            <li>Avoid blocking scripts (e.g., poorly implemented tracking)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In projects I create under the TomaszChromy.com brand, I treat this as standard, not an "additional option" – because it's part of product quality, not a gadget.</p>

          <h2>5. How to Monitor Core Web Vitals After Launch</h2>
          <p>Performance is not a one-time action. Even if everything is green at the start, over time:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>New scripts are added (e.g., marketing, chat)</li>
            <li>The number of images grows</li>
            <li>Hosting changes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>That's why it's worth:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regularly checking the Core Web Vitals report in Google Search Console</li>
            <li>Doing a brief "performance review" once a quarter – especially if the website is heavily developed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A good practice in long-term cooperation is to include this as a retainer element: every month/quarter we check performance and fix what's needed.</p>

          <h2>6. Summary</h2>
          <p>Core Web Vitals are not "Google's whim" or a topic only for programmers. It's a very practical indicator of whether your website is fast, responsive, and stable – meaning whether it doesn't discourage people before they even see the offer.</p>
          <p>If you invest in traffic (SEO, ads, social media), treat performance as part of customer acquisition cost. Because every second of delay is leads you'll simply never see.</p>

          <p class="text-xl text-cool-200 mb-8">Website accessibility has been treated as "nice to have" for years. Since WCAG 2.2 became an official W3C standard and increasingly appears in legal requirements and tenders, we're talking about a real business obligation, not just for public administration.</p>

          <p>In this text, I explain what WCAG 2.2 practically means for a business owner and how to approach the topic when designing or modernizing a website/application.</p>

          <h2>1. What Is WCAG 2.2 in a Few Sentences</h2>
          <p>WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of guidelines designed to ensure equal use of websites and applications by people:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With visual or hearing impairments</li>
            <li>With cognitive difficulties</li>
            <li>Using keyboard instead of mouse</li>
            <li>Using screen readers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Version 2.2 adds nine new criteria including minimum size for touch elements, ease of authentication, focus stability, and interaction simplicity on mobile devices.</p>

          <h2>2. Why Business Should Care</h2>
          <p>There are three reasons:</p>

          <h3>Legal risk</h3>
          <p>In many countries (especially EU), legal requirements for website accessibility are increasing even in the private sector (banks, e-commerce, mass services).</p>

          <h3>Wider customer base</h3>
          <p>People with disabilities are a real part of the market. An inaccessible website means they simply cannot use your offer.</p>

          <h3>Better UX for everyone</h3>
          <p>Many accessibility principles (contrast, readable typography, logical navigation) improve comfort for all users, not just those with formal limitations.</p>

          <p>Additionally, Google increasingly values "page experience" and content accessibility as an element of page quality.</p>

          <h2>3. Key WCAG 2.2 Areas from a Website Owner's Perspective</h2>
          <p>Instead of getting into criterion numbers, let's look at this from a business perspective.</p>

          <h3>a) Readability and contrast</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Appropriate font size (min. 16px on web)</li>
            <li>Sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)</li>
            <li>Font that's easy to read (without decorative "tricks")</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>b) Clickable element size</h3>
          <p>Buttons and links should have a minimum size of 24×24 px (ideally 44×44 px on mobile). This is important for people with motor impairments and anyone using a phone on the go.</p>

          <h3>c) Keyboard navigation</h3>
          <p>Every element on the page (menus, buttons, forms) should be accessible without a mouse. Focus states should be visible – the user needs to see where they are.</p>

          <h3>d) Forms and authentication</h3>
          <p>Forms should be simple, with clear error messages, without forcing users to remember codes or perform complex operations.</p>

          <h3>e) Content alternatives</h3>
          <p>Images should have alt descriptions, videos should have subtitles. This also helps SEO.</p>

          <h2>4. How to Approach Accessibility Practically</h2>

          <h3>If you're creating a new website:</h3>
          <p>Require accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.2 at level AA (standard for most commercial websites) as part of the specification.</p>

          <h3>If you have an existing website:</h3>
          <p>Order an accessibility audit. It can be done manually or with automated tools (like axe, WAVE), but a comprehensive review requires expert knowledge.</p>

          <h3>Make it part of the process:</h3>
          <p>Accessibility isn't something you add at the end – it's designed from the start. Choose a contractor who understands this.</p>

          <h2>5. What I Apply in My Projects</h2>
          <p>On tomaszchromy.com and similar projects, I apply:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimum clickable element size</li>
            <li>Clear focus and hover states</li>
            <li>Clear heading hierarchy</li>
            <li>Logical tabulation order</li>
            <li>Appropriate contrast and font sizes</li>
            <li>Semantic HTML (headings, lists, sections)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This increases the chance that the user will complete the entire journey instead of getting frustrated.</p>

          <h2>6. Summary</h2>
          <p>WCAG 2.2 is not a topic "for programmers" or "for the public sector." It's a business standard that affects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Legal risk (and this is growing)</li>
            <li>Market reach (people with disabilities are customers too)</li>
            <li>General UX (accessibility = good design for everyone)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you're planning a new website or modernizing an existing one, include WCAG 2.2 in the requirements from the start. It's cheaper than fixing it later – and it shows you care about all your customers, not just the "ideal" ones.</p>
